1
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.580
Welcome to the class,
A Crash Course in Data Science.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.330
I thought I'd start off by
telling you a little bit about

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.740
the instructors in the class.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.380
The three of us are actually
the co-instructors and co-developers of

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.670
the Executive Data Science Specialization
and so we're all gonna be part of this

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.340
first class and getting you comfortable
with and introduce you to data science.

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.800
So I thought I'd tell you
a bit about each of us.

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.610
So Brian Caflo is a professor of
Bio Statistics here at John Hopkins.

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.610
He works primarily in the analysis of
data from neuro-imaging experience.

10
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.700
So, he leads a team of data scientists
that analyze that type of data and

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.540
interact with medical professionals and
scientists here at Johns Hopkins campus.

12
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.990
I am also a data scientist
here at Johns Hopkins.

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.350
I'm a associate professor
of Bio Statistics and

14
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.060
Oncology here at Johns Hopkins and I work
primarily on the analysis of genomic data.

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.050
And so that's the data about your
genome and how you use that genome and

16
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.300
relate it to personalized medicine and
other areas where you can use your genome

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
to tell you something about how you're
going to vary compared to other people.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.460
And then the third
instructor is Roger Peng.

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.170
And Roger Peng is also
an associate professor here in

20
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.280
Bio Statistics at Johns Hopkins, and

21
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.310
he works primarily in the analysis of
data from environmental health studies.

22
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.000
And so
he analyzes again data sets that come in

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.750
that relate environmental health
data to other public quantities that

24
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.930
are of interest to regulators and
other people.

25
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.840
And so, the two of us, Roger and I,

26
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.470
actually write a blog together,
the Simply Statistics blog and so

27
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.980
that blog deals with a lot
of data science issues.

28
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.030
It covers a lot of the material.

29
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.400
You might see some of those blog
posts pop up in later lectures and

30
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.310
then the three of us also co-created the
Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization,

31
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.070
which is actually a more low level
specialization focused on, actually,

32
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.305
how do you actually, do the grunt
work of data science day to day.

33
00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:47.575
And so, this overview in this class is
gonna be more like a crash course in

34
00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:50.395
the concepts of data science and
how they apply,

35
00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:52.835
and how you can use them
when you're managing people.

36
00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:53.705
Welcome to the class.
