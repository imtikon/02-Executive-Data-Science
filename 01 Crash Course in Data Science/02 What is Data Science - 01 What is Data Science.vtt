1
00:00:03.463 --> 00:00:05.320
So this is a crash course in data science.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.370
And so the first question you might
ask yourself is, what is data science?

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.520
So this is a blog post that I wrote for
our blog Simply Statistics,

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.170
that talked about how the key word in
data science, is science, and not data.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.540
So the key issue when you're analyzing
a data set, or when you're trying to use

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.260
data to help your business, or
to help your organization move forward is

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.820
to know that data science is only useful
when you're actually using that data to

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.930
answer a specific, concrete question that
could be useful for your organization.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.900
So it turns out that this definition
actually ends up in the actual definition

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.710
of data science in Wikipedia, and, as we
know, Wikipedia is the main source of most

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.270
people's information, so
we literally define data science.

12
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.580
So a couple of example of this,

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.420
we'll illustrate what I mean
by what is data science.

14
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.675
So one of the examples that you about
a lot when you hear about data science is

15
00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:51.256
Moneyball.

16
00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:54.410
And so, in Moneyball, the idea was,

17
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.230
can we build a winning baseball team
if we have a really limited budget?

18
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.050
Now they used quantification
of player skills,

19
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.250
and a new metric that's more
useful to answer that question.

20
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.460
But the key underlying question that
they were asking, the key reason

21
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.440
why this is a data science problem was,
could we use the data that we collected to

22
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.410
answer this specific question which is
building a low budget baseball team.

23
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.530
A second question would be, how do we find
the people who vote for Barack Obama and

24
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.640
make sure that those people end
up at the polls on polling day?

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.330
And so this is an example from
a study of Barack Obama's data team,

26
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.760
where they went and they actually
tried to analyze the data, and

27
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.850
run experiments to identify those people.

28
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.000
And they ended up being a surprising
group of people that weren't necessarily

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.730
the moderate voters that
everybody thought they would be,

30
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.752
that could be swayed to go out and
vote for Barack Obama.

31
00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:46.500
And so, this is again an example where
there was a high-level technical issue

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.350
that had been used to basically A B
testing on websites and things like that,

33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.860
to basically collect and identify the data
that they will use to answer the question.

34
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.780
But at the core,
the data science problem was

35
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.860
can we use data to answer this
question of voter turnout, and

36
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.890
the right kind of voter turnout to make
sure a particular team wins an election.

37
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.340
So another data science
question is the Netflix prize.

38
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.910
So here the idea was, Netflix wants to
keep people watching movies, and so

39
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.490
to get them to watch those movies, you
need to keep producing recommendations of

40
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.670
movies that they might like to watch
after they've finished watching one.

41
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.280
And so, the idea here is
the question is how can we

42
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.900
show people movies that they'd like
to see so they'll keep watching, and

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.220
then they use data, basically
the preferences of other people like that

44
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.770
person to try to predict which
movies that they would like.

45
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.891
So this is another example where there is
some technical high-level machine learning

46
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.432
techniques that were used
to do these predictions but

47
00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:44.230
at the core the question was, how can we
identify movies that people will like.

48
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.803
And so I've talked a lot about how data
science about answering questions with

49
00:02:47.803 --> 00:02:49.480
data and that's definitely true but

50
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.930
there are also some other
components to the problem.

51
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.160
So, data science is involved in
formulating those quantitative questions,

52
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.452
identifying the data that could be used
to answer the questions, cleaning it,

53
00:03:00.452 --> 00:03:05.130
making it nice, then analyzing the data,
whether that's with machine learning, or

54
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.650
with statistics, or
with neural networks or whatever.

55
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.625
And then communicating that
answer to other people.

56
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.680
And so another component of that, that
often gets left out in these discussions,

57
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.150
is basically the engineering
component of it.

58
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.330
So one example of that
is this Netflix prize.

59
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.560
So in the Netflix prize, they had a whole
bunch of teams competing to try to predict

60
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.820
how best to show people what
movies to watch next, and

61
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.470
the team that won blended together a large
number of machine learning algorithms.

62
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.210
In other words, they predicted the result
with a large number of machine

63
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.370
learning algorithms and
then cleverly averaged them together.

64
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.210
But it turns out that's really
computationally hard to do, and so Netflix

65
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.590
never actually ended up implementing the
waiting solution on their system, because

66
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.780
there wasn't enough computing power to do
that at a scale where they could do it for

67
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.320
all their customers.

68
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.580
So this is an example of how there
are different components to the data

69
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.980
science process.

70
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.450
There's the actual data science,
the actual learning from data.

71
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.560
And doing, discovering what
the right prediction model is.

72
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.150
And then there's the implementation
component which is often

73
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.610
lumped into data engineering which
is how you actually implement or

74
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.090
scale that technology to be able to apply
it to, say, a large customer base or

75
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.550
to a large number of people all at once.

76
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.580
And so there are these trade-offs
that always come up in data science.

77
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.970
The tradeo-ffs between interpretability
and accuracy or interpretability and

78
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.510
speed, or interpretability and
scalability, and so forth.

79
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.480
So you can basically imagine that there
are all these different components to

80
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.850
a model whether it's in It's
interpretable, simple, accurate, fast, and

81
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.410
scalable.

82
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.540
And you have to sort of make judgments
about which of those things are important

83
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.540
for the particular problem
that you're trying to solve.

84
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.020
And so, another component of this is
like being able to identify what's hype

85
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.090
and what's not.

86
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.370
And so, this is an example of the hype
cycle where there's sort of the peak of

87
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.610
inflated expectations, followed by
when everybody gets disillusioned with

88
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.040
the technology and
a plateau of productivity.

89
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.850
We're sort of just coming out to that part
where data science, people have really

90
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.830
starting to figure out how to use
data science to solve key problems.

91
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.160
And so
we're about to see a lot of productivity.

92
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.940
You can kind of think about it
as the 1999 for data science.

93
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.590
So it's an exciting time to
be involved in it because

94
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.340
even relatively simple data
science tools used well to

95
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.550
answer very specific questions can have a
major impact on you and your organization.
