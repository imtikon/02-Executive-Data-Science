00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.960
This lecture discusses the basic
structure of a data science project.

2
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:13.085
A typical data science project will be
structured in a few different phases

3
00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:16.630
that I'll talk about in
separately in this lecture.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.910
So there's roughly five different
phases that we can think about

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.280
in a data science project.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.970
The first phase is
the most important phase,

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.490
and that's the phase where
you ask the question and

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
you specify what is it that you're
interested in learning from data.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.282
Now, specifying the question and
kind of refining it over time is really

10
00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:39.743
important because it will ultimately
guide the data that you obtain and

11
00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:41.845
the type of analysis that you do.

12
00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:46.751
Part of specifying the question is also
determining the type of question that

13
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:48.350
you are gonna be asking.

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.840
There are roughly six types
of questions that you can

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.210
ask going from kind of descriptive,
to exploratory, to inferential,

16
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.960
to causal, to prediction,
predictive and mechanistic.

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.240
And so figuring out what type
of question you're asking and

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.300
what exactly the question is,
is really influential.

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.840
And so you should spend a lot
of time thinking about this.

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.240
Once you've kind of figured
out what your question is, but

21
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.600
typically you'll get some data.

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.550
Now, either you'll have the data or you'll
have to go out and get it somewhere or

23
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.760
maybe someone will provide it to you,
but the data will come to you.

24
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.033
And then the next phase will
be exploratory data analysis.

25
00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:27.590
So this is the second part, there are two
main goals to exploratory data analysis.

26
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.100
The first is you wanna know if
the data that you have is suitable for

27
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.231
answering the question that you have.

28
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:37.686
Then so this will depend on a variety of
factors depending on very basic things

29
00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:40.870
like is there enough data, are there too
many missing values, things like that.

30
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.050
To more fundamental ones,
like are you missing certain variables or

31
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.180
do you need to collect more data
to get those variables, etc?

32
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.070
The second goal of
exploratory data analysis is

33
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.670
to start to develop
a sketch of the solution.

34
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.240
And so if the data are appropriate for

35
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.060
answering your question,
you can start using it to kinda sketch

36
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.260
out what the answer might be to get
a sense of kinda what it'll look like.

37
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.620
This can be done without any formal
modeling or any kind of the statistical

38
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.780
testing of things like that just to get
a good picture of what it might be.

39
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.160
The next stage, the third stage,
is formal modeling.

40
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.750
So if you're sketch kind of works out,

41
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.670
you've got the right data and
it seems appropriate to move on,

42
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.510
the formal modeling phase is the way
to kind of specifically write

43
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.570
down what questions you're asking,
what parameters you're trying to estimate.

44
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.160
And it also provides a framework for
challenging your results.

45
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.496
So just because you've come up with
an answer in the exploratory data analysis

46
00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:37.633
phase doesn't mean that it's necessarily
going to be the right answer and

47
00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:41.179
you need to be able to challenge
your results through a variety of

48
00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:45.273
approaches where the sensitivity
analysis are other types of analysis.

49
00:02:45.273 --> 00:02:49.545
So challenging your model and just
developing a formal framework is really

50
00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:53.274
important to making sure that you
can develop robust evidence for

51
00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:55.380
answering your question.

52
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.080
The next phase is interpretation so
once you've done your analysis your

53
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.350
formal modeling you wanna think about
how to interpret your results and

54
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.470
there are a variety of things to think
about in the interpretation phase

55
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.180
the data science project.

56
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.730
The first is kinda like think about
how your results jive with kinda what

57
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.440
you expected to find when you
where first asking the question.

58
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.580
And also you wanna think about
the kind the totality of the evidence

59
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.210
that you've developed.

60
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.850
At this point, you've probably
done many different analysis,

61
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.450
you probably fit in many different models.

62
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.300
And so you have many different bits
of information to think about and

63
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.790
part of the interpretation
phase is to kind of

64
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.680
assemble all that information to weigh
the different pieces of evidence.

65
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.560
So that you know what kind or

66
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.870
which are more reliable, which are more
important than others and to get a sense

67
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.130
of the totality of evidence with respect
to kind of answering the question.

68
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.260
The last phase is the communication phase.

69
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.760
Any data science project that
is successful will wanna

70
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.330
communicate its findings
to some sort of audience.

71
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.850
Now that audience may be internal to
your organization, it may be external,

72
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.490
it may be to a large audience or
even just a few people.

73
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.002
But communicating your findings is
an essential part of data science in it

74
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:06.987
because it informs the data
analysis process and

75
00:04:06.987 --> 00:04:09.695
a it translates your findings into action.

76
00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:13.923
So that's the last part which is not
a formal part of a data science project

77
00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:18.219
necessarily, but often there will be
some decision that needs to be made or

78
00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.650
some action that needs to be taken.

79
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.470
And the data science project will
have been conducted in support

80
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.810
of making a decision or taking an action.

81
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.220
So that last phase will depend on more
than just the results of the data size or

82
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.210
the data analysis, but may require

83
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.920
inputs from many different parts of an
organization or from other stakeholders.

84
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.100
So ultimately if the decision is made,

85
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.350
the data analysis that was done will
inform that decision and will support and

86
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.170
the evidence that was collected
will support that decision.

87
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.530
So these are roughly the five
phases of a data science project.

88
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.270
There's the question, there's exploratory
data analysis, there's formal modeling,

89
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.000
and there's interpretation,
and there's communication.

90
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.836
Now, there is another
approach that can be taken,

91
00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:04.363
it's very often taken in
data science project.

92
00:05:04.363 --> 00:05:07.032
And that is to really
start with the data and

93
00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:09.860
to start with an exploratory
data analysis.

94
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.620
So often there will be
a data set available, But,

95
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.320
it won't be immediately clear kind of
what the data set will be useful for.

96
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.500
So it can be useful to kind of do some
exploratory data analysis, to look at

97
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.800
the data, to summarize it a little bit,
make some plots, and see what's there.

98
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.570
And to generate some interesting
questions based on the data.

99
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.980
So this is sometimes called hypothesis
generating because it kind of produces

100
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.790
questions that were already there.

101
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.110
Once you've produced
the questions that you wanna ask,

102
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.630
based on your initial kind of
exploratory data analysis,

103
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.840
it may be useful to kind of
get more data or other data

104
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.010
to kind of do an exploratory data analysis
that's specific to your question now.

105
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.170
And then continue with the formal
modeling, interpretation and

106
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.400
communication.

107
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.400
One thing that you have to be wary of is
to do the exploratory data analysis in one

108
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.050
data set, develop the question, and
then go back to the same data set.

109
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.580
And pretend like you hadn't done
the exploratory data analysis before and

110
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.500
come at it with say a fresh question.

111
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.270
That goes on to the rest of the stages.

112
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.955
This could often be a recipe for
kind of, for bias in your analysis.

113
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:16.900
Because the results were
derived from the same data set.

114
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.343
So it's important to be careful about
doing that and to try to obtain other data

115
00:06:21.343 --> 00:06:25.538
when you're using the data to generate
the questions in the first place.

116
00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:30.798
So this is the secondary approach to data
science that can be very useful and can

117
00:06:30.798 --> 00:06:36.740
often result in many interesting questions
that are generated from the data.

118
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.593
Data science projects have a variety
of phases and it's important to kind of

119
00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:44.445
understand which phase you're in so
that you know kind of how to progress and

120
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:47.056
how to move forward with
any data science project.
