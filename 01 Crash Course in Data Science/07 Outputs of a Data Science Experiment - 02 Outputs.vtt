00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.050
Hi, this is a brief lecture about
the outputs of a data science experiment.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.980
So some of the most common forms of
output from a data science experiment

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.210
include reports, presentations,
interactive web pages and apps.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.860
For me probably the most common
output from a data science experiment

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.810
is a report, and so, let's for
each of these things,

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.720
talk about the hallmarks of good
output from a data science experiment.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.670
So let's focus on reports first.

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.748
Ideally reports should be clearly written,

9
00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:36.049
they should involve
a narrative around the data.

10
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:40.254
A narrative that goes from the data
creation to the analysis to clear

11
00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:45.290
conclusions, or if there aren't clear
conclusions, a discussion of why not.

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.021
So the conclusions should be concise,
and any un-details, or

13
00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:55.112
side bars should be left to a minimum,
so omit unnecessary details.

14
00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:58.647
I think this is probably one of
the biggest issues with a lot

15
00:00:58.647 --> 00:01:00.243
of the reports that I see.

16
00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:04.935
But one thing again, in your domain,
how and what is done for

17
00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:09.811
reports, there's going to be a lot of,
kind of terms of art and

18
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:12.572
specifics of the art for your case.

19
00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.704
One thing that we'd like to harp on is
something that's common across most

20
00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:18.449
settings, is the idea that
the reports should be reproducible.

21
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.740
The idea of reproducibility, is that
if someone goes back to the report,

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.340
the report and the analysis,
the code that creates the analysis and

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.000
the data can be embedded
in one single document.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.860
And this document will help so that if
someone tries to reproduce the report two

25
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.970
months later, say with the same
starting data set, they should

26
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.380
get the same numbers, and these tools
will help ensure that can happen.

27
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.695
And some of the tools like Ipiecon
notebooks in Nitter and R,

28
00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:52.349
are available so that you can help
the people that you manage try to

29
00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.733
produce reproducible reports.

30
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:58.969
In addition, there's a lot of
benefits to reproducible reports,

31
00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.321
such as the documents tend to document the
code very well because the documentation,

32
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:08.734
the report itself and the analysis
are embedded in the same document.

33
00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.251
It helps people think about the analysis,

34
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:13.123
because they're thinking about the report
while they're doing the analysis.

35
00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:18.922
So, there's quite a few benefits
to using some of these tools for

36
00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:21.249
reproducible research.

37
00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.522
The same set of criteria should
also go for presentations as well.

38
00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:29.802
Presentations should be clear, they should
involve a narrative around the data,

39
00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:34.324
they should have concise conclusions, and
they should omit unnecessary details, and

40
00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:38.357
maybe less well known is that there's
a lot of tools for reproducibility, for

41
00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:40.893
presentations just like there are for
reports.

42
00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:45.002
I'm thinking in specifics of
Slidefy in our studio's presenter,

43
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:49.253
and some of these tools that make
very beautiful, nice presentations

44
00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:54.243
that similarly embed the analysis and
the presentations into a single document.

45
00:02:54.243 --> 00:02:58.732
And in addition to reproducibility,
just like with reports,

46
00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:04.406
these have many side benefits of helping
how you think about the presentation,

47
00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:10.690
and archival purposes, many other benefits
to this style of creating presentations.

48
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.090
It hasn't caught on that much,
not anywhere near as much as the report

49
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.629
writing has, but
still it has many benefits.

50
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.390
So, I'm gonna lump web pages and apps
together as a single thing to talk about,

51
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.970
cuz I think you could make a fairly

52
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.890
easy case that an interactive web
page is just an app of a form.

53
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.090
And these should be easy to use, they
should have help pages or documentation,

54
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.860
and some things that we're gonna talk
a lot about in the specialization of it.

55
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.330
The code should be documented well,
so that when you manage someone and

56
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.810
they leave and someone else comes
later on to maintain the app or

57
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.110
the web page, they'll know how to do it.

58
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.363
They'll come in later, or even if
the person who's doing it puts it down for

59
00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.071
several months and has to go back to it,

60
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:05.526
having good documentation is going
to help them do that better.

61
00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:10.487
The second thing that we harp on a lot in
this specialization is that code should

62
00:04:10.487 --> 00:04:14.468
be version controlled, and
the tools like Git and GitHub, and

63
00:04:14.468 --> 00:04:19.829
other tools like Subversion are available
now, to make version control very easy.

64
00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.614
So, we think part of best practices
should be executing a culture

65
00:04:25.614 --> 00:04:31.833
of version control and reproducibility
in your management process.

66
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:36.057
Let me just go through an app here,
my former master student John Buscheli,

67
00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:41.260
who's now a PHd student in the department
working with chip ground created in China.

68
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.780
He created this great app for the ENAR,

69
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.800
the Eastern North American Regional bio
statistics, bio metrics conference.

70
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.610
Where they didn't have a, they didn't
have a website or an interactive website,

71
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.530
so he scraped the PDF with a program and
created this website, but it's very easy

72
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.430
to use, the fields are all somewhat
obvious, and there's a very clean design.

73
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.740
Again, he's not gonna win any awards for
this, but it was highly useful for

74
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.140
the collection of people at ENAR, and

75
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.799
I think they try to contact
him every year to do it again.

76
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.300
Here's another great app that occurred
in the data products class, and

77
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.560
I want to kinda harp on one
specific part of this app.

78
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.280
This was created by Alex Lem, and

79
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.840
this is an app that maps
the Syrian refugee crisis.

80
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.990
You click on a component of the map, and

81
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.720
then it gives you some demographic
information about the refugees, and

82
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.420
this was well and beyond I think what was
required for the data products class.

83
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.420
So, he really did a nice job with this and

84
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.390
you can see it's a very
beautiful web page.

85
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.310
But more than anything, he created some,
he was very considerate to the users

86
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.119
by creating some very nice instructions
and a manual over here to the side.

87
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.460
It's easy to use, but

88
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.200
more importantly, it's very well
documented exactly how to use the app.

89
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.780
So I hope in this lecture you got
a little bit of a sense of the kinds

90
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.235
of things that could be output from
a data science experiment, the sort of,

91
00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:12.155
we like to call them data products that
could result, and maybe some insights, at

92
00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:16.445
least some of the insights that we have,
about what make for good data products.

93
00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:18.735
Thanks again and
we'll see you in the rest of the class.
