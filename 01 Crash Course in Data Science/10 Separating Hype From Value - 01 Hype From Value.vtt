00:00:03.348 --> 00:00:05.580
You've probably heard a lot
about data science and big data.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.140
And there's been a lot of
hype around these areas.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.830
And so I think what that's done, is it's
sort of inflated expectations about what

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.350
a data science and
data can actually accomplish.

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.560
And I think overall that's
just been a net negative for

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.720
the field of data science and
for big data.

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.880
So I wanted to talk a little bit about
what is the way what are the questions you

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.060
can ask to separate data science
hype from data science hope and

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.790
so if you look at this sort of the hype
curve the traditional hype curve that

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.755
people talk about I think that we've
seen a lot about inflated expectations.

11
00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:37.275
And we're sort of just now coming out
into this sort of productive plateau,

12
00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:39.135
where people actually know
what to do with data.

13
00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:40.505
They know how to data science.

14
00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:43.365
So it's a perfect time to start,
you know, managing those teams.

15
00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:47.445
And managing expectations in a way
that's really clear, and really focused.

16
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:51.995
So the first question you need to ask
yourself, is what problem have you solved

17
00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:56.740
ever that was worth solving where you knew
all of the given information in advance?

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.980
Where you didn't have a surplus of
information and have to filter some of it

19
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.230
out, or you didn't have insufficient
information and have to go find some?

20
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.330
And so that's kind of the key.

21
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.550
That's at the heart of data science.

22
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.320
That's actually a quote from Dan Meyer who
was talking about mathematics education.

23
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.910
But it's also at the heart
of data science.

24
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.790
It's basically trying to decide what
information do you have, is it useful, and

25
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.930
then what information do you need and
can you get it?

26
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.340
So the first question is,

27
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.280
what is the question you are trying
to answer with the data?

28
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.770
So if someone comes to talk to
you about a big data project, or

29
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.860
a data science project, and
they start talking about the hottest new

30
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.340
cool technology they can use to
do distributed computing, and

31
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.960
analyze data with machine learning and
they throw a bunch of buzz words at you.

32
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.960
The very first question you should ask
is what is the question you're trying to

33
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.010
answer with data.

34
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.050
Because that really narrows
the question down and

35
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.440
it filters out a lot of the hype around
what tools and technologies people

36
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.310
are using which can often be very
interesting, fun to talk about.

37
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.980
I like to talk about them too but

38
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.379
they're not really gonna add
value to your organization.

39
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.950
The second question to ask is,

40
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.560
once you've identified what that question
is you're trying to answer with the data.

41
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.190
And this is the really hard one,

42
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.350
is, do you have the data to
actually answer that question?

43
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.560
So often the question that you wanna
answer and the data that you have to

44
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.080
answer it with are not actually
very compatible with each other.

45
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.380
And so the first question you have to
kinda have to ask yourself is can we get

46
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.670
the data in a shape, where we can actually
answer the question we want to answer?

47
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.440
And sometimes the answer is just no, in
which case, you kind of have to give up.

48
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.950
So, if you want to decide on whether
a project is hype or whether it's reality,

49
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.880
you need to decide, is the data the people
are trying to use actually relevant for

50
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.300
the question they are trying to answer and
then,

51
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.760
the third thing you need to answer is.

52
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.250
If you could answer the question
with the data you have,

53
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.590
suppose that you could perfectly answer,
you knew that you could do that,

54
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.990
the question is, could you even use
the answer that you've collected?

55
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.920
So this goes back to that idea from the
Netflix prize where there was a solution

56
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.160
to the problem of predicting which
videos people would like to watch.

57
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.240
And it was a very very good solution.

58
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.330
But it wasn't a solution that could be
implemented with the computing resources

59
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.270
that Netflix had in a way that was
sort of financially expedient.

60
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.020
Even though they could
answer the question,

61
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.320
even though they did have the right data,
even though they were answering a specific

62
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.040
question, they couldn't actually apply
the results of what they figured out.

63
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.600
So if you ask these three questions,
you can very quickly decipher whether

64
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.460
a data science project is about hype or
whether it's

65
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.800
about a real contribution that can
really move your organisation forward.
