00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.500
Welcome to this class on
building data science teams.

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.540
I'm really excited to teach you about
recruiting, managing, organizing, and

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.060
evaluating data science teams to help
your organization get better with data.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.750
I thought I'd tell you a little
bit about myself to start.

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.371
So I'm very excited about data and data
science, and I do a few different things

6
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:24.573
that are related to data and
data science because of that excitement.

7
00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:29.190
So the first thing I wanted to tell you
about is I blog at simplystatistics, so

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.070
you can also find me on
Twitter @simplystats.

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.630
I talk about a lot of data science issues,
a lot of statistical issues, and

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.140
then a few more inside baseball
issues related to academics.

11
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.570
I do that with a couple of colleagues,
Roger Peng and Rafael Irizarry.

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.250
Roger Peng is another instructor
in this sequence with me.

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.820
I also teach in the Johns Hopkins
data science specialization.

14
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.830
So the Johns Hopkins Data Science
Specialization is a sequence of

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.120
nine classes.

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.650
And it's focused on teaching
data scientists who are actually

17
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.110
going to be on the ground doing data
science day to day how to do their jobs.

18
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.410
And so
that set of classes is incredibly popular.

19
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.070
It has enrolled over two million people.

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.140
And this sort of executive data
science sequence is sort of

21
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.920
building on the success and excitement
around that data science sequence.

22
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.130
And then finally I actually manage a team
of data scientists here at John's Hopkins.

23
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.880
I'm an associate professor of
biostatistics here at John's Hopkins, and

24
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.280
I lead a team that works on
data science for genomics.

25
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.960
So you can think of this as a way to use
genomic information say to personalize

26
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.000
health or to understand
natural biological variation.

27
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.270
So a lot of what I do day to day is
actually managing data scientist and

28
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.340
organizing them and
getting them to work with others.

29
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.644
And so I'm going to share some of
the experiences that I have from doing

30
00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.100
that here at John Hopkins, and

31
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.210
hopefully help you to manage
your data science teams better.

32
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.640
I'm really looking forward
to seeing you in class.
