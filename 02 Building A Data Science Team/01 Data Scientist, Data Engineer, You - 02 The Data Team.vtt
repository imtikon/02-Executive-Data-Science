00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.190
So the first thing to know when
building a data science team,

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.110
is that data science is a team sport.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.250
It takes a large group of people
working together to solve real,

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.350
practical data science projects.

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.700
So those people include
the data scientists.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.700
The managers of those data scientists,

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.100
data engineers who perform and
develop the infrastructure.

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
And then people who they have contact
with outside of their data science team.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.150
So people within the organization or
management of the organization,

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.460
and how do they communicate
with those people?

11
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.410
So I just thought I'd go through the key
positions in the data science team.

12
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.180
And so the first one is a data engineer.

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.040
So, a data engineer is a person that
would maybe construct a database, or

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.470
they might pull data out of that
database for people to analyze.

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.080
Or they might build production level
machine learning algorithms and

16
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.020
implement them on servers, so that they
can be applied to a huge database of

17
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.370
observations of data, and
maybe even run in real time.

18
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.420
So they have skills in infrastructure
development, both the hardware side and

19
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.750
the software side.

20
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.480
And they do less of the actually
analysis of the day to day data.

21
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.220
That falls to the person that's
called a data scientist.

22
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.030
So a data scientist might be somebody that
would go and pull data out of a database.

23
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.860
Then they might analyze it, perform
experiments on it, visualize it and

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.700
communicate those results to
the data science manager, and

25
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.300
to other people in the organization
to try and move things forward.

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.530
Often, a data scientist will hand off
any machine learning algorithm or

27
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.310
prediction algorithm they develop,
to the data engineer,

28
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.080
who will then implement it so
it can run at scale.

29
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.510
The third key person is the data
science manager, so that would be you.

30
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.090
The data science manager, makes sure that
everybody interacts with each other and

31
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.340
that they keep things moving.

32
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.250
They also recruit and
build the data science team.

33
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.440
And then they also interface with
upper management in an organization.

34
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.980
As well as with collaborators that are at
their same level across the organization,

35
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.820
to make sure that they get
all the information across.

36
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.455
And they advertise the data
science team to other people,

37
00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.595
what their capabilities are, what they
can do, and how they can help out.

38
00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:03.995
So that's the data science team,
and then how do they work together?

39
00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:08.625
They work together as a unit, and so
often each of these people are working

40
00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:12.910
on individual projects, or individual
subproblems of a data science problem.

41
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.510
And then they come together and have joint
group meetings and joint presentations,

42
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.520
where they discuss their ideas.

43
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.790
They also interact with external folks,
they might interact with those people

44
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.670
directly through individual meetings with
people outside of the data science team.

45
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.380
Or they might interact through
the data science manager.

46
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.420
So, in either way they have to be able to
communicate what's going on with the data

47
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.360
science infrastructure, what's going
on with the data science team.

48
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.600
And how do they make sure that all
the problems are getting solved.
