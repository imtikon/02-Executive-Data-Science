00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.950
So, the way in which you'll interact with
data science depends a little bit on

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.940
what kind of organization you are.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.920
To some extent, it depends a lot
on the size of your organization.

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.150
So, when you're just a start up,
when you're an early stage company, or

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.180
you're just one person
with a very small team,

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.450
maybe like one other person working for
you.

7
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.030
You may not need to worry so much yet
about how to do experimentation,

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.460
how to do machine learning, how to do sort
of prediction and downstream calculations.

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.430
The first order of business is just making
sure your sort of data house is in order.

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.610
And the way to do that is to make
sure you focus on infrastructure.

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.480
So the first thing that you need to do
is build out the infrastructure for

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.860
storing the data,
the databases and so forth.

13
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.070
The software that's gonna
be run to pull those data,

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.070
the servers that are gonna serve
the data to other people, and

15
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.150
the servers that you'll interact with
yourself in order to get the data out.

16
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.560
So all that sort of requires
infrastructure building up at first.

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.690
So often the first people that you
get to hire into a data science team,

18
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.780
are not people that you would necessarily
called data scientists in the sense that

19
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.230
they're not analyzing the data,
they're not doing machine learning.

20
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810
They might do a little bit of that but

21
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.370
mostly they're involved on just
making sure the machine is running,

22
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.750
making sure the data's getting collected,
its secure, its stored and so fourth.

23
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.100
So when your a mid size organization,

24
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.460
then hopefully you've got
the basic infrastructure in place.

25
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.110
And you can start thinking about building
out your real data science team.

26
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.990
And so to do that you can bring on board
people that are actually called data

27
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.970
scientists.

28
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.050
And those are the folks who will
then actually use the data.

29
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.410
So they might pull it out of the database.

30
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.990
They might run some experiments.

31
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.980
They might build machine
learning algorithms.

32
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.200
They might analyze the data to see
if you can identify any patterns or

33
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.530
trends in behavior that you care about.

34
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.820
And so at that point,

35
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.300
you're thinking about actually
building out the data science team.

36
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.110
You're also thinking about implementing
these data science ideas and products.

37
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.850
So again, the data scientist might
build something like a machine learning

38
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.740
algorithm that predicts,
say, consumer behavior.

39
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.650
Once you have that algorithm built out,

40
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.970
you might need to implement
it back on to your system.

41
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.530
And you might need to scale it up, so
that it can be run on the whole data set.

42
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380
You might wanna build some
sort of visualization,

43
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.420
that people who aren't necessarily
data scientists can interact with.

44
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.940
And so, that would be turning it back
over to the data engineering team.

45
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.150
So there's still infrastructure concerns,

46
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.220
because you have a large set of data that
you've hopefully collected at this point.

47
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.390
You need to be secure about it,
you need to have a database,

48
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.690
you need to be able to scale it.

49
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.439
But, now you're sort of graduating into
a more complete view of data science.

50
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.920
For a large organization you have
all those same sorts of things.

51
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.470
You now have a data infrastructure,

52
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.080
you might have a data science
team that's running experiments.

53
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.890
You may be using those
experiments to make decisions.

54
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.580
But now you have one additional component
which is really managing the team and

55
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.810
keeping everybody on task and coordinated.

56
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.730
So at this point the data science manager
role becomes a little bit more involved,

57
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.570
in the sense that you might be
coordinating multiple teams of data

58
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.390
scientists working on different projects.

59
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.140
You might have a team that works
exclusively on building machine

60
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.340
learning projects.

61
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.230
You might have another team that works
exclusively on running experiments and

62
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.640
inferring what you can
from those experiments.

63
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.190
And then someone has to be in charge of
coordinating those activities making sure

64
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.690
they're connected to the right
people within your organization.

65
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.390
Whether that's the marketing team,
the business group or

66
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.040
whoever else that you're
collaborating with.

67
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.250
You have to be able to
connect those people.

68
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.770
And so at that scale the full data
science infrastructure is in place.
