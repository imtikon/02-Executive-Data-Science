00:00:02.173 --> 00:00:05.923
One of the key members of a data
science team is a data engineer.

2
00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:09.072
And so I'm gonna talk a little bit
about what are the qualifications and

3
00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.133
skills that you might
need in a data engineer.

4
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.370
So what does a data engineer do?

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.640
They might do things like
build infrastructure.

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.810
So they would build out what are your
databases, the hardware for that.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.800
Whether it's purchasing that, and
organizing it, and ordering it.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.665
Or they might build out your system for
actually computing on that,

9
00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:28.300
whether it's what servers they're gonna
buy and how they're gonna organize that.

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.854
And what software they're gonna
run on top of the database,

11
00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:33.830
what software they're gonna
run on top of the server.

12
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.760
And then,
they manage the data storage and use.

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.340
So they might monitor how those work.

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.630
They might monitor who,
what people are using which data.

15
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.920
They might pull data out and
give it to somebody.

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.990
And then they might
implement production tools.

17
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.170
Now each of these is a different thing,
and so

18
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.630
you might not have one person
that does all of these things.

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.040
Certainly at the beginning,
when you're a very small organization,

20
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.180
you might need one person that can kind
of handle the entire data infrastructure.

21
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.630
And then you might get more specialized
people as you get to be a larger and

22
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.550
larger organization.

23
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.010
So the question is,
what skills do they need?

24
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.084
So they might need some knowledge of
what's the right hardware to be looking

25
00:01:09.084 --> 00:01:11.730
for, both in terms of storage and
in terms of computing.

26
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.050
They might need to have some
knowledge about databases software.

27
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.980
They might need to know a little bit
about software for computing and

28
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.180
what are the different software needs
that your organization might need.

29
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.850
In that sense, they need to be able
to interact with the data scientists,

30
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.900
once you have them.

31
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.240
They need to be able to know what
software they need to be able to install,

32
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.710
what kind of data pulls that
people will frequently do.

33
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.500
That will all inform users of hardware
choices that they're going to be making.

34
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.150
And so, they also need to understand data
processing at scale, almost always now,

35
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.090
and if you're a data driven organization,

36
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.170
you're collecting a massive
amount amount of data.

37
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.424
So you need to be able to run at
scale those data processes and

38
00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:47.760
those data prediction algorithms
that you've developed.

39
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.383
And then they need to understand
software engineering at the level of,

40
00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:53.227
they need to know how they're gonna
interact with all these other components

41
00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:54.200
of the data science team.

42
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.190
And so the background for data
engineers is often computer science and

43
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.390
computer engineering, but
they could also come from other places.

44
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.460
They might come from a quantitative
background with some computer science

45
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.650
experience that they picked up maybe in
online courses or in courses in person.

46
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.540
Or maybe they come from information
technology where they've actually been

47
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.840
involved in infrastructure building and
so forth.

48
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.875
Again, sort of like with
the data scientist,

49
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.640
you might depend on what your
organization needs a little bit,

50
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.260
which of these specific
backgrounds is most useful to you.

51
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.220
But the primary thing you're looking for

52
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.980
is, can they execute those jobs that
your organization needs them to execute?

53
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.420
Are they able to build infrastructure?

54
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.070
Are they able to maintain
the infrastructure that you need them to

55
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.220
be able to maintain?

56
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.660
Can they implement the data science,

57
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.750
or machine learning algorithms, or
statistical experiments, at scale for

58
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.520
your organization in the way
that you would like them to.

59
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.600
So again,

60
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.520
the key is to get them to be able to
solve the problems that you need now.

61
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.090
With a data engineer, the balance of
solutions versus software might be

62
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.500
a little bit different
then a data scientist.

63
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.360
Since this person is the person that's
going to sort of be maintaining the data

64
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.060
stack for you, you need them to be able to
do that in a way that's consistent with

65
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.280
the way that your
organization does things.

66
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.840
So they need to be able to have an idea
about what are the specific software and

67
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.210
hardware needs that your organization has.

68
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.349
There are a few sort of key things that
they need to know, they might need to know

69
00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.630
how to build and manage some databases,
things like SQL, things like MongoDB.

70
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.046
They might also need to know how to
do things like implement or run,

71
00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:23.710
things like Hadoop, which is
a parallel processing infrastructure.

72
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.963
Now it's not necessarily true that they
need to know any one of these buzzwords

73
00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:29.190
or another.

74
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.622
But it is true that they need to have the
combination of skills that allow them to

75
00:03:32.622 --> 00:03:36.170
build out a data infrastructure that's
supportive and that can be maintained.

76
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.145
So there's a couple of key
characteristics that you're looking for

77
00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:41.410
when you're looking for a data engineer.

78
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.550
So first, again, they need to be
willing to find answers on their own.

79
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.269
This is again, a person that often will
be one of the few people that's solely

80
00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.970
responsible for the data infrastructure.

81
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.790
And so, often they need be able to
answer those questions themselves.

82
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.830
They need to be able to go out and
get the quotes on the Internet.

83
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.110
They need to be able to ask questions and
figure out what's the right hardware,

84
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.920
and what's the right security
measures to be taking, and so forth.

85
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.920
Often they will have to do that a little
bit on their own, in the sense that,

86
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.000
the data engineering team is often
very specific and expert in an area.

87
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.050
Where it's not clear that other people
within your organization will be able to

88
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.160
give them a lot of advice.

89
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.840
They need to know a little
bit of data science.

90
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.710
They need to know how data is used,
how it's pulled, how it's analyzed.

91
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.520
So that they know how to build
the infrastructure that's useful for them.

92
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.580
Ideally, they'll be closely
collaborative with the data scientists,

93
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.560
maybe they've done that before.

94
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.850
And then they need to be able
to work well under pressure.

95
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.700
And so one reason for
that is that the data infrastructure for

96
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.370
an organization is often very critical.

97
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.810
And if it goes down then, say,
your website might go down, or

98
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.240
you won't be able to do any analysis, or
the organization sort of grinds to a halt.

99
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.900
And so having a data engineer that's
able to work well under pressure,

100
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.840
that's able to keep things up and
running, and keep things maintaining.

101
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.840
That makes good decisions about
software maintainability, and hardware

102
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.860
maintainability, and somebody that's
critical for your data engineering team.

103
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.330
And again, friendly but relentless, so

104
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.500
they need to be able to
interact with people.

105
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.530
Again, their personal communication skills
are highly undervalued but are very,

106
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.119
very important.

107
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.900
There's gonna be a lot of steps at which
a data engineer is gonna have to interact,

108
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.000
especially at first in a small
organization but even later on,

109
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.780
with data scientists, with other people
in your organization, and external units.

110
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.520
And so you need to be able to have
a friendly conversation with them.

111
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.030
And ideally,

112
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.460
they can explain in very simple terms
why they need to make certain decisions.

113
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.860
So often the decisions, especially
these days, are quite technical,

114
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.280
quite involved with the hardware and
software involved.

115
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.940
And so it's very useful if they can,
in very simple language,

116
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.770
explain what's going on, what the problem
is, how it's gonna be fixed, and so forth.

117
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.210
That can be a huge advantage
to your organization.

118
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.093
So that's what a little bit about,
what a data engineer is.
