1
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.980
So when you're building out
your data science team,

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.700
one of the key roles that you'll be hiring
for, no surprise, is a data scientist.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.530
So this lecture is a little bit about
what to look for in a data scientist.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.360
So what does a data scientist do?

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.370
As it's typically defined, a data
scientist runs experiments, pulls and

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.920
cleans data, analyzes it and
then communicates the results to people.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.750
So they have to have a set of skills
that allow them to perform all of

8
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.130
these activities.

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.930
And so we're going to talk a little
bit about all of the different

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.550
specific skills that a data
scientist might need in

11
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.650
order to be able to achieve this minimum
set of tasks that they will have.

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.480
Now this is one definition of
a data scientist, obviously

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.590
they're other definitions of data
science that are going around right now.

14
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.610
And depending on your definition of
data science, you might have to like,

15
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.210
move the qualifications just a little
bit in one direction or another.

16
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.200
It also depends a little bit how
mature your organization is.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.050
If you're hiring dedicated
data scientists,

18
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.710
this is likely something
like their job description.

19
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.570
If you're at a very early stage, and
you're hiring your first data science

20
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.610
team members, they might have to be
a little bit more of a jack of all trades.

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.130
They might need to be able to do
a little bit more data engineering,

22
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.560
as well as data science.

23
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.400
So I'm talking here about a sort of
a mature organization that is hiring data

24
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
scientists.

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.850
So, then I'm going to talk a little
about what skills they need.

26
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.750
So they need to be able to do statistics.

27
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.430
So, often they'll have learned
that either in classes, so

28
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.400
that they will have a qualification in
statistics, whether it's a degree or

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.340
they've taken a large number of classes,
or they've taken some online classes.

30
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.730
They probably need to know something
about prediction and machine learning.

31
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.380
So you can often learn that from
either statistics classes or

32
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.830
from computer science classes
that focus on machine learning.

33
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.060
Again, you can also learn that online.

34
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.850
Those are two different tasks,
inference and prediction.

35
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.330
And so,
we've learned about that in other classes.

36
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.470
And it's important to know that some
people will be better at one, and

37
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.830
some people will be better at the other.

38
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.040
And it kind of depends on what
your organization is doing.

39
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.700
If they're doing more like,
building out predictive tools,

40
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.000
they might need to be a little
stronger machine learning.

41
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.710
If you're trying to do experiments and
come up with new hypotheses,

42
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.430
they might need to be a little
bit better at inference.

43
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.590
They also need to be able
to do data analysis, and

44
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.310
that means the whole picture,
they need to be able to pull data sets out

45
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.690
of a database, they need to be able to
analyze those data sets, clean them up.

46
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.250
Perform the statistical inference or

47
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.860
prediction that they want to do and
then communicate those results.

48
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.560
So data communication skills involve
both being able to analyze the data,

49
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.660
create nice visualizations,
communicate those visualizations in

50
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.900
the results that people in a way that
both expresses what's going on and

51
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.150
carefully expresses how
uncertain they are.

52
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.480
So when you're making decisions,
you know exactly how strongly the data

53
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.810
are supporting the decision
that you're trying to make.

54
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.460
So those are the main qualifications
that they need to have,

55
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.330
the skills that they need to have.

56
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.390
That being said, data scientists usually
have a few of the following skills.

57
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.650
They usually, they know how to use r or
Python So those are general purpose data

58
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.580
science languages that people
can use to analyze data.

59
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.520
They know how to do some
kind of visualization.

60
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.760
Sometimes interactive visualization
with something like D3.js.

61
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.092
And they might know definitely how
to pull data out of a database.

62
00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:59.920
So, they would have experience
with at least one database, SQL,

63
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.660
MongoDB, something like that.

64
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.520
Where they've actually interacted
with pulling data out of a database.

65
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.230
So the very common backgrounds for
data scientists are that they came from

66
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.310
a statics or biostatistics department,
they learned a lot of applications, so

67
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.320
they've actually worked on
lots of real data sets.

68
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.400
That's not always true in statistics and
biostatistics department, but

69
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.890
it's usually true for applied statistics
and biostatistics departments.

70
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.470
And then they've picked up a little
bit of software engineering

71
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.560
they know a little bit about version
control they know a little bit about

72
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.020
programming in other languages and so
those sorts of things allow them to sort

73
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.770
of interface with the other
people in your company but

74
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.690
they're primarily focused in training and
statistics.

75
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.790
Another very common route to data science
is if you do some kind of quantitative

76
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.740
background say for
example physics or engineering, and

77
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.980
then there's some sort of
data science transition.

78
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.520
So they either take some classes online,
like our data science specialization, or

79
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.720
they take some other data science program.

80
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.990
There are lots of transitioning data
science programs, and then they're sort of

81
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.560
Prepared to do data science, but they have
a quantitative or experimental background.

82
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.530
and then the last category that's very
common among data scientists is that

83
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.340
they'll actually trained
in software engineering.

84
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.140
They're actually a trained
software engineer,

85
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.670
or a working software engineer, and
they just pick up some statistics.

86
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.150
Now, they might pick that up,
again, from classes online,

87
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.590
or they might have taken
some courses in college.

88
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.890
And again, it'll depend the mix of
what your organization is looking for.

89
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.040
Are they looking for a person that's going
to do more infrastructure development

90
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.780
blended with a little bit of statistics?

91
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.010
Then it might be better to go for

92
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.120
somebody with a software engineering
plus statistics background.

93
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.390
If you already have an organization,

94
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.690
you really need to be able to do
experiments and make inferences from them.

95
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.610
Going after with somebody from
a Biostatistics Department, for example,

96
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.670
might be a much stronger place to go and
look for your candidate.

97
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.750
So it depends a little bit on
the needs of your organization.

98
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.270
So one thing to keep in mind is that a key
component of being a good data scientist

99
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.830
is not being intimidated by new
kinds of ideas or software.

100
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.410
On the flip side, that means that in some
cases it's really important that you look

101
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.250
for somebody that has specific
software engineering skills, or

102
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.720
specific programming language and
skills that your organization needs.

103
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.570
But you'll often miss out on really
strong candidates by doing that.

104
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.160
And so, one really good idea is to
assess in general, are they a go getter?

105
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.370
Are they able to learn new things?

106
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.780
Are they able to do this sort of general
purpose data science tasks that you want?

107
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.780
And then try to figure out if they'd
be able to pick up on the fly,

108
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.760
the languages that you would need them
to use for your particular problem.

109
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.620
So the key here is, focus on the problem
not on the software programming languages

110
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.390
when you're looking for data scientists,
cuz you'll tend to miss a huge sloth of

111
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.360
people, particularly right
now in the transition.

112
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.340
And while people are sort of the field
of data science is relatively new and

113
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.120
there's not a standardized curriculum for

114
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.830
training data scientists across
all these different disciplines.

115
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.890
So what are the key characteristics
of data scientists that you might

116
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.110
be looking for?

117
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.580
One is, that they're willing
to find answers on their own.

118
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.950
So, often a data scientist has to
come up with their own data sets,

119
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.610
they have to be able to pull data sets
from the organizations, they have to be

120
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.920
able to collaborate with people to figure
out what the right problem to solve is.

121
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.720
And so they need to be able to
chase that down on their own.

122
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.280
You can't always be holding their hand.

123
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.340
So what can you do?

124
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.838
You can go look for evidence of this,
whether that's through leadership that

125
00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.230
they've taken on at their
previous organizations.

126
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.470
Whether it's through open source software,
or whether it's through blogging, or

127
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.010
something else where they communicate
that they've gone out and

128
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.370
they've actually been willing to
go get the answers on their own.

129
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.590
They need to unintimidated by new data.

130
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.120
A question that often gets asked, a very
smart question to ask when interviewing

131
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.960
a data scientist, is to throw out a kind
of data that they've never seen before,

132
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.230
whether it's from your organization or
even data that you might have just

133
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.720
imagined from a different organization,
and see how they react to it.

134
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.260
If they react in a way that's positive,
they have ideas,

135
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.550
they think about ways to try to
tackle that problem, that's great.

136
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.410
If they're intimidated by that data type
and they're just trying to force it back

137
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.790
into the box of the data they know,
that might be very challenging as your

138
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.460
organization changes and
the data science changes for them.

139
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.220
And then, it's important that they're
willing to say, I don't know.

140
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.870
This is often hard to get out
of a person in an interview, but

141
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.500
it's important to know that, if they
don't know the answer to a question,

142
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.880
maybe you asked them a question about
your organization that's very specific

143
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.040
That they wouldn't know the answer to.

144
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.790
You need to see if they're
comfortable saying, I don't know,

145
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.160
because often data come to no conclusion.

146
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.560
It's very common for
you to do an experiment and

147
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.080
the conclusion is, we don't know very
much more than we knew before we started.

148
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.690
It's frustrating, and it's one of
the hard parts about data science.

149
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.970
But is important to know that people will,
when faced with that,

150
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.520
are comfortable saying "I don't know," so

151
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.820
that you know that they'll be
communicating the truth to you.

152
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.620
Finally, I guess the way I put it, but
it's put differently by different people,

153
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.230
is that they're friendly but relentless.

154
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.690
In the sense that data science requires
a lot of dedication to getting all

155
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.620
the details right, to making sure
that you interact with people in

156
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.050
a way that moves things forward,
even when they're sort of faced with.

157
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.750
Not necessarily the most
friendly response in return.

158
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.460
And so they need to be very friendly,
they need to have people skills,

159
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.410
those soft skills that come with being a
data scientist are incredibly critical in

160
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.220
a data science team where they're
gonna be working with other people,

161
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.820
they'll be your point of
contact with external units.

162
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.600
And so, it's actually a kind of a grossly
under valued skill in data scientist.

163
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.950
I would say that typically,
people over-value the technical component.

164
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.290
Like do they know programming language X?

165
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.570
And de-value, can they have a conversation
with me that doesn't get testy if I'm

166
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.660
questioning some of their
deep-held beliefs about data?

167
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.782
And so, that's an important component is
making sure that they'll fit in well with

168
00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:25.719
your organization
