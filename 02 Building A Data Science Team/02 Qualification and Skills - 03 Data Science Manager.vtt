1
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.330
The last member of the data science
team is a data science manager.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.440
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about
the qualifications and skills.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.900
These might be your qualifications and
skills, if you're taking this class.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.806
So what does a data science manager do?

5
00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:14.711
Well, the first that they
might be responsible for

6
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:16.140
is building the data science team.

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.090
They are responsible for identifying,
and recruiting data engineers, and

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.940
data scientists to the team.

9
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.050
Getting them set up, setting goals and
priorities, identifying those problems

10
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.930
within an organization that need
to be solved by data science,

11
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.440
and sort of putting the right
people on the right problem.

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.530
So then,
they manage the data science process.

13
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.910
So data science,
as you'll learn in another class,

14
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.800
is a process that's not just one time,
one all thing.

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.360
It's an iterative process, and so
it needs to be managed carefully.

16
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.093
And so, that is one of their
responsibilities is making sure that

17
00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:51.728
people interact with each other
within the data science team,

18
00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.578
but also interact with other people
in the external organization.

19
00:00:54.578 --> 00:00:56.630
And they also interact with other groups.

20
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.980
So they might report to higher management.

21
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.360
They might also just interact with,
or collaborate with

22
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.400
people at their same level and
their units of your organization, and

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.010
so they need to have good
communication skills in that sense.

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.580
And so, what kind of skills do they need?

25
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.535
Ideally they have knowledge of
the software and hardware being used.

26
00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:18.730
That's great if they have some kind of
background in either data science or

27
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.480
data engineering.

28
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.930
That's sort of the ideal case.

29
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.557
That's ideal,

30
00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:25.566
because then they actually kind of know
the infrastructure that's involved.

31
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:29.921
If there's a problem that comes up they
might have a good suggestion about how to

32
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:34.536
fix the data science infrastructure, or
how to fix that machine learning algorithm

33
00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:37.985
that doesn't necessary work
exactly like the person wanted.

34
00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:40.980
They don't have to have that
qualification, but it'd be nice.

35
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.920
They do need to know the roles, they
need to know what a data scientist does,

36
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.100
what a data engineer does, what other
teams are supposed to be doing, and

37
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.950
how that may or may not be data science.

38
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.460
And so, part of that is a filter, so that
they can sort of filter out the problems

39
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.450
that aren't necessarily appropriate,
and focus on the ones that are.

40
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.950
They need to know what can and
can't be achieved.

41
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.120
So data science is useful and
it can be a very powerful tool for

42
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.410
an organization, but
it's not all purpose and all knowing.

43
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.830
And so, there's often problems that
just can't be solved with data science.

44
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.750
That could be because
the data aren't available.

45
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.700
It could be because algorithms aren't
good enough to be able to do that kind

46
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.740
of prediction at that time.

47
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.200
It could be because we can
definitely solve the problem, but

48
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.450
we just can't scale it up to
the scale that's necessary.

49
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.470
So they need to kind of have an idea of
what are the global parameters of what can

50
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.290
be done and
what can't be done with data science.

51
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.570
And then obviously, strong communication
skills, because they're going to

52
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.008
be communicating with their own team,
they'll be interfacing with other units.

53
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.560
And so, they need to be able to
communicate with what's going on.

54
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.660
And so,
what is the background of data managers?

55
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.330
So data managers ideally come from
some sort of data science background.

56
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.970
Whether that's analyzing data themselves,

57
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.910
or building data science infrastructure
themselves plus some management training.

58
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.160
That might be you if you've taken, say,
the data science specialization series and

59
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.290
now you're taking this series.

60
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.630
You kinda have data science background
plus management background.

61
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.420
Or you might have data engineering and
again management experience.

62
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.920
There's also another option is that you
have some management experience, but

63
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.990
you've also taken or learned a little bit
about data science and data engineering.

64
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.680
And ideally you've learned about it at
least at the depth where you'll be able to

65
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.580
come up with those suggestions
if those people get stuck.

66
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.090
At the high level it's good that you know
how to direct and set priorities, and

67
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.080
know what's possible and not possible,
but ideally you can also sort of

68
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.420
get in the mix and
help people out if that's possible.

69
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.290
The best managers at some level or
another know enough data science or

70
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.440
data in general that they can
contribute to the team in that way.

71
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.435
So their key characteristics are that
they're knowledgeable about data science.

72
00:03:37.435 --> 00:03:40.578
That they're supportive, data science and
data engineering are often very

73
00:03:40.578 --> 00:03:42.851
frustrating components of
being in an organization for

74
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.350
lots of different reasons.

75
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.680
And so, being positive and supportive and

76
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.302
motivational is really important when
identifying a data science manager.

77
00:03:50.302 --> 00:03:54.184
Being thick-skinned is also really
important, it often falls on the data

78
00:03:54.184 --> 00:03:58.500
science manager to report disappointing
results from a prediction algorithm, or

79
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.381
an experiment that failed, they often
have to report that to management or

80
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.684
people that might not
be too happy about it.

81
00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:08.253
And so, they have to be willing to do that
in a way that's positive and friendly and

82
00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:09.682
like moves on to the next thing.

83
00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.357
So thick-skinned is very important for
a data science manager.

84
00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:16.991
And again, polite, but relentless,
friendly, but relentless,

85
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.000
they'll get out there and
really work with people.

86
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.650
They can communicate with them, but they
advocate for and use data science in a way

87
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.260
that's really positive for
the whole organization and for their team.

88
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.730
And so, that's what you're looking for
in a data science manager.

89
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.761
Somebody that can kinda organize the whole
process, keep it going, and move people

90
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:38.646
onto the right problems and solve the real
problems that your organization has.
