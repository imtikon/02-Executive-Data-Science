00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.170
So now that you know the qualifications
of data scientists, data engineers,

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.290
data science managers,
the whole data science team,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
you need to know where you can go and
find those sorts of people.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.100
The obvious place to look is the general
purpose sites, LinkedIn or Monster.com or

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.760
something like that, where you go out and
you search for data science.

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.790
This can be a little bit hard to do,
because there are a large,

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.600
large number of people that call
themselves data scientists.

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.820
And so it's a hot area right now and

9
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.090
it can be a little bit hard to identify
who are the people that are really good

10
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.850
from who are the people that
aren't necessarily good.

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.940
Now it's not impossible, you can look for

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.080
the right programming languages for
each of the different roles.

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.870
You can look for past experience.

14
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.880
Ideally they have some kind of projects
online, whether that's through something

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.180
like a GitHub profile where they show
their software or hardware background.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.980
So ideally you have some sort
of toehold on what they know

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.250
if you go to these sort
of general purpose sites.

18
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.125
Another place that you can go is you can
go to sort of more dedicated sites, so

19
00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.570
kaggle.com hosts data
science competitions.

20
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.250
They also have a very large job board
with lots of people who are looking for

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.510
data science jobs.

22
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.280
There you're gonna tend to find people who
have at least a little bit of experience

23
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.550
in data science, cuz you also know
If they've competed in competitions,

24
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.600
what their skills are, how they're doing.

25
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.010
You can go to places like
Insight Data Science,

26
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.820
or you can go to places like hire.com.

27
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.940
These are sort of more dedicated places
that are focused exclusively on hiring and

28
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.700
building data scientists, and so

29
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.890
you know a little bit more
about their qualifications.

30
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.200
There's a little bit less
of a filtering process.

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.820
That may or may not be useful, depending
on how specific are the needs of your

32
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.030
institution or your organization
versus what's being trained or

33
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.460
what they hire in these
particular websites.

34
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.370
So in that case, if you're looking for
somebody that's a little outside the mold,

35
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.730
maybe the general purpose site might be
better with a little bit more searching.

36
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.210
If you're looking for sort of a more
traditional data scientist or

37
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.510
data engineer,
you might go to these more specific sites.

38
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.640
You can also look at people who
have taken classes online, and

39
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.600
find the people that are coming
out of those classes.

40
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.940
People that take classes on Coursera
data science programs, for example,

41
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.650
our data science specialization, or
through Udacity's program on data science,

42
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.120
or other online data science programs.

43
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.650
Often the best way to find them is
they have profiles on GitHub or

44
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.570
other sites where they put up
all their data science projects.

45
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.430
And so you can kind of get
a little bit of a feel for

46
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.370
how they work right from the start,
before you even interview them.

47
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.240
So you can go search for

48
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.650
them through the sort of sites
where they might have information

49
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.250
posted because most of these sort of
programs have them build portfolios or

50
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.330
profiles which they put online, which
makes it easier for you to find them.

51
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.303
And so another place to go look for people
is through these sort of people who have

52
00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:40.457
qualifications in these online classes.
