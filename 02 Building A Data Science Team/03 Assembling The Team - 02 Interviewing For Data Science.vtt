1
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.190
So once you've identified the people that
you wanna bring in, or people who've

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.720
applied to your organization,
the next step is interviewing them, and

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.150
trying to figure out if they're a good
fit for your data science team.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.410
So the structure of a data science
interview is usually is follows.

5
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.150
Usually you have individual or

6
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.700
group meetings where you meet
either one on one with the person.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.530
Or you have a small group
of people meet with them.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.300
Then you have some kind of demonstration
or presentation of their skills, and

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.820
then maybe a test of their
technical skills as well.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.015
So those are usually the three main
components of the data science interview.

11
00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:34.560
And so,
I'm gonna talk about each of these.

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.600
So the first is individual meetings or
group meetings.

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.010
So this kind of depends on
the size of your organization.

14
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.670
How many people they'll meet at once,
whether it's a few people, or one person.

15
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.690
And ideally they will meet both people
inside the data science team as well as

16
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.520
people outside the data science team, so
you can get feedback on whether they've

17
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.160
communicated well with both internal
people and external people.

18
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.120
So the key here is to focus on
the projects that they've worked on.

19
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.360
Try to illicit as much information as
you can about how they work on projects.

20
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.200
Whether they're go-getters, whether
they can go figure it out on their own.

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.380
It's also very critical that
you assess at this stage.

22
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.740
The resume will tell you a lot
about their technical skills.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.730
It will tell very little about
their interpersonal skills.

24
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.150
So this is sort of a critical stage
where you need to dissect and identify,

25
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.260
are they a person that will easily work
with other people in your organisation.

26
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.460
Ideally, you want to do this in such a way
that it's sometimes good to have people

27
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.860
can make people a little
uncomfortable as data scientists.

28
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.970
Again, that's gonna be part of their
job is they might come up with ideas,

29
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.785
when they might analyze data, and come to
conclusions that aren't super popular.

30
00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.951
But you might still wanna be able
to communicate with them, and

31
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:42.173
you'll be able to do
that in a friendly way.

32
00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:45.214
Here you're gonna want to focus on
the global evaluation of skills.

33
00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:49.410
So some people have used
technical recruiting questions.

34
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.930
Although, a lot of large organizations,
including really famous data science

35
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.680
organizations, have kind of moved
away from that in interviews,

36
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.380
sort of the riddle type of questions.

37
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.110
Or the mathematical type puzzle questions
are sort of not in favor any more,

38
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.970
and I think I agree with that in the sense
that it's very unuseful in a very

39
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.660
confined setting to know how somebody's
gonna react to a specific tricky puzzle.

40
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170
It's usually like, have they
studied that kind of puzzle before,

41
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.030
is a better predictor than
their actual abilities.

42
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.870
And so, it's better to ask sort
of general purpose questions.

43
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.600
How would you tackle this kind of problem?

44
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.060
How would you, in general,

45
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.550
build out the infrastructure to
solve this kind of security risk?

46
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.480
So you wanna focus on, maybe some drill
down into some technical details, but

47
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.760
you definitely want to focus on
their conceptual understanding.

48
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.200
Do they know how to tackle the problems?

49
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770
Do they know the right
sort of language to speak?

50
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.900
Do they know the right
technologies to talk about?

51
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.050
Do they seem like they have experience in
solving the sorts of problems that you'd

52
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.110
ask them to solve if they
came onto your organization?

53
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.200
The next key component, and some
organizations don't do this, but I think

54
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.430
it's very important when interviewing any
data scientist, data engineer, or data

55
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.740
science manager, is to have them do some
kind of demonstration or presentation.

56
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.950
This is good for a couple of reasons.

57
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.260
One, it's an ability for
them to show their own creativity and

58
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.080
show their own sort of unique contribution
that they can bring to your organization.

59
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.150
So if they do a presentation about
a data analysis they've done, or

60
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.940
an infrastructure they've built, or they
demo some software that they build, or

61
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.500
if they talk a little bit about
their management techniques and

62
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.550
how they would manage a data science team.

63
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.360
It's important to get sort of that
information about what's creative or

64
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.770
unique about them.

65
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.830
It's also a communications skills check.

66
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.910
Almost always data scientist,
data engineers, data managers,

67
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.930
they're going to have to present
their results to people.

68
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.320
And so, it's good to evaluate right from
the get-go, are they able to do that,

69
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.550
are they able to answer
questions on their feet.

70
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.930
Are they comfortable with presenting
information that's technical and detailed.

71
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.450
It's also an opportunity for
a broader group to interact with them.

72
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.990
So you can only have so many individual or

73
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.390
small group meetings with
any person at any given day.

74
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.314
But if you have a nice big presentation
for them to give with a larger group of

75
00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:56.510
people, it gives more people
a chance to sort of weigh in on.

76
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.320
Does this person seem like the kind
of person that would fit into our

77
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.029
organization?

78
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.960
So finally, there's often
an evaluation of technical skills.

79
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.360
Now, there are two kind of
schools of thought here.

80
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.522
One is very technical,
maybe even like riddle-like problems.

81
00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:17.500
And the other is to actually have them try
to solve a very small but real problem.

82
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.750
So I think that the latter case
is usually much more effective.

83
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.890
So for a data scientist, you might
give them a very small data set, and

84
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.510
see if they can do an analysis on it and
report.

85
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.050
It might take them only an hour, cuz
it's very small, or something like that.

86
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.720
And then, you afterwards
have an interview with them.

87
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.200
You go through what they did,

88
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.050
and get a feel for what their
thinking process is really like.

89
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.730
Ideally, you'd give them a problem or

90
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.680
a project that's related to what
your organization does every day.

91
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.210
It might be a simulated example or
a fake example, so

92
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.880
they don't get access to any real data,
but it gives you an idea.

93
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.910
How are they gonna operate
day-to-day in the organization?

94
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.989
So those are the three components,
you have individual or group meetings.

95
00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:59.575
You have a demonstration or
presentation of their skills, and

96
00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:02.430
then you have some evaluation
of their technical skills.

97
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.508
Then you collect all the information
from everybody who saw them, and

98
00:05:05.508 --> 00:05:08.814
you make a judgment on whether they're
a right fit for your organization.

99
00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:09.314
