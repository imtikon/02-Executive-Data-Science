00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:07.298
So once you've hired a member of the data
science team and they show up on their

2
00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:10.381
first day of work, it's important
that you have a system in place so

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:12.900
that they can quickly get into the flow.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.480
This is a way to waste a lot of time if
there's not a good system for them to

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.950
get all of the support and the help that
they need to get up and running as quickly

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.880
as possible and really start helping
your organization as fast as they can.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.830
So the onboarding process usually
starts with an initial meeting.

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.550
So this should be with
whoever their manager is.

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.620
And they should go over an overview of
their position, what the expectations are.

10
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.520
In particular, what are the projects
that you'd like to have them complete,

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.680
who they're supposed to interact with and
at what time scale.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.260
And are you gonna start those
interactions, or do they need to go and

13
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.320
start those interactions themselves?

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.550
GIving them the contact information of
any of the people that they need to be

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.250
in contact with,
throughout the entire process.

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.020
And then,
establishing any sort of policies.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.460
So, often, it makes a lot of
sense to set up policies for

18
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.270
how you're gonna interact
with the internal team.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.365
How are you going to
communicate with them?

20
00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.990
What's okay and what's not okay
in terms of feedback and review?

21
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.370
The same sort of thing for
external interactions.

22
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.340
So, how are you gonna
interact with other people?

23
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.940
Is that all gonna flow through
the management of the data science team?

24
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.790
Or is that gonna be embedding people
briefly in other teams during the week?

25
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.220
And how are they gonna
communicate with them?

26
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.190
All of that needs to be laid out,
ideally in a short,

27
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.900
initial meeting where they actually get
all that information sort of compressed.

28
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.310
It's really ideal if that information
could be stored somewhere internally

29
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.260
on a level that they can communicate with.

30
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.350
Whether it's a website, or some kind
of document that's distributed, so

31
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.810
that they actually can
always have a reference for

32
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.900
who they should be contacting,
how they should be acting, and so forth.

33
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.880
So, that's the ideal way to make sure
that they always have that information

34
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.260
available to them.

35
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.730
The next step is usually human resources,
so they need to get set up with payroll.

36
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.360
They need to get set up with benefits,
any kind of documentation they need.

37
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.710
So this isn't really part of
the data science process, but

38
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.630
it is always a step that needs to happen
in the onboarding process for people.

39
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.700
Then the next thing that needs
to happen is introductions.

40
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.720
And so
that person might have interviewed, and

41
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.140
you might have even be aware
that they're showing up.

42
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.210
But it's really good to have that
person be able to go around and

43
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.730
put a face to the name for all
the people within the data science team.

44
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.334
So this is ideal if you, as the manager,
can go and take them from place to place,

45
00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:22.779
introduce them to all the data science
team, make sure they get to know them,

46
00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.581
they have a few minutes to talk, and so,

47
00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:27.960
that everybody knows who
the new member of the team is.

48
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.130
You also might want to introduce them
their external points of contact.

49
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.748
Whatever external units they'll be working
with, or collaborators they'll be working

50
00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:37.640
with, make sure that you do
a direct introduction of them.

51
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.230
So that everyone knows the new person
is here, the new data scientist, or

52
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.370
data engineer,
who they're gonna be interacting with,

53
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.000
how to contact those people,
how you want that process to work.

54
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.630
If you sort of initiate that yourself,
then it makes it a little bit smoother for

55
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.520
them to know where to
go in the organization,

56
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.200
if that's all sort of outlined
right from the beginning.

57
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.790
Right from the get go.

58
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.770
Another thing that all data scientists or
data engineers will need is equipment and

59
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.890
communications.

60
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.310
So often they'll either have a computer,
or you need to get them a computer

61
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.890
associated with the activity of
what they're going to be doing.

62
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.220
Let them know what software is
available for them to install,

63
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.630
what their purchasing limits are in terms
of organizing how they can get software.

64
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.600
You also need to let them know how to
interact with your global infrastructure.

65
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.150
How do they do data polls?

66
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.180
What's their username?

67
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.030
How do they interact with sort
of the global infrastructure and

68
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.330
the hardware that you have?

69
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.058
Ideally, again, you have documentation for
this, whether it's a PDF or

70
00:03:33.058 --> 00:03:37.380
some other documentation that you can give
them, share with them through the internal

71
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.004
communication channels,
that shows them, okay.

72
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:43.052
Here's where all the data is stored,
here's the kind of database we're using,

73
00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:45.130
here's the way to pull
data out of that database.

74
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.185
Sort of tutorials and introductions,
so they can immediately get up and

75
00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:51.920
running without having to go and ask
a hundred questions at the data engineer.

76
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.830
Okay, where is the data?

77
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.200
What's the data set stored under?

78
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.210
What's the sort of framework under
which we're storing all this stuff?

79
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.905
And then get them set up on
the communication channels that are useful

80
00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:03.450
for you.

81
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.770
So some organizations like to just
communicate by email or through chat.

82
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.280
What if there's something like Slack,

83
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.530
where they communicate
with each other as a team.

84
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.330
And so it's important that you get
them set up and running on whatever

85
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.610
the communication channel is, the one that
your organization particularly focuses on.

86
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.770
And so, after you've got their equipment
set up and you've got them sort of ready

87
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.550
to go, the best thing to do
with any data scientist or

88
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.920
data engineer is to set them
up with an initial problem.

89
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.990
So obviously what you'd like is
that this person can come in and

90
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.400
immediately start having an impact, and
immediately identify all of the problems

91
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.130
your organization might need to have
solved, but that usually never happens.

92
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.110
Each organization is a little bit quirky.

93
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.880
They have particular problems that they
care about and that they don't care about.

94
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.460
And so the best way to get somebody up and
running immediately,

95
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.230
is to start them on a small, a finite,
concrete project right away.

96
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.750
So this might be, for a data scientist,
it might be an analysis that is

97
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.120
just a small analysis, that they can
work on just right away, that day.

98
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.792
They can already start asking questions,

99
00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:02.888
and they can already start
interacting with people.

100
00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:06.846
Ideally, it's a short duration project,
so that they can just get up to speed.

101
00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:09.861
They can kind of get started on something,
they can get their feet wet.

102
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:12.820
It's the same sort of thing for
data engineers or data science managers.

103
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.419
You wanna give them a short,

104
00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.030
concrete project that they
can use sort of a jump start.

105
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.980
So, obviously you're going to want
them to work on larger scale projects.

106
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.110
They might have long term projects that
you're going to want them to work on.

107
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.060
But if they get something under their
belt, right away, that's a solution

108
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.000
they can present, first of all,
it' gives them a lot of confidence.

109
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.650
Second of all, it's the best way.

110
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.810
The absolute best way to get them
integrated into a team is to have them

111
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.450
working on a project right away.

112
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.900
So, the first thing that you do,
is you give them that initial project,

113
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.890
along with all of the other, sort of,
documentation that you need.

114
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.820
And then, you turn them loose.
