1
00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:06.431
Once your team is up and running,
then the process of managing or

2
00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:08.429
maintaining the team
as it goes forward and

3
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.310
answers data science problems is a
critical role for a data science manager.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.110
So the first thing that you would often
have with every member of your team,

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.120
ideally, is individual meetings.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.830
So this will happen particularly if you
are at the first stage of management where

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.490
you're managing just a few people.

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.440
Once your organization
gets a little bit bigger,

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.020
there'll be a hierarchical structure and

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.040
you might not necessarily meet with
every member of the team every week say.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.930
But if you're only managing a few people,

12
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.580
it's a really good idea to have a standing
regular meeting where they can come and

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.440
they can present anything
that they're working on.

14
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.210
Things that they've accomplished,
things that they finished and so

15
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.270
you can sort of check them off
as things that have gotten done.

16
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.040
Any kind of problems that they have and
their goals for the week.

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.080
And so, individual meetings take up a lot
of time, if you spend them, well they

18
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.410
can be a huge advantage in the sense that
people often get stuck in data science on

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.230
something that can easily be resolved
just by having someone else look at it.

20
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.360
A lot of times, this has happened to me,
where I'm analyzing some dataset, and

21
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.310
I just get stuck on some low level detail,
and I can't quite figure it out.

22
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.020
And then as soon I show it to
somebody else they immediately spot,

23
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.550
whatever it was that was slowing me down.

24
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.950
So this is sort of the best and most
effective way to get people unstuck and

25
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.570
keep them moving.

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.930
The second thing that makes a lot of sense
to have is Data Science Team Meetings.

27
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.830
So that's get the whole
data science team together.

28
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.440
Again, this should be a regular
standing meeting that you have so

29
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.650
that everybody can come together and
talk about what they're working on.

30
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.780
So again they can share any updates
of any progress that they've made.

31
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.400
They can identify any problems that they
are working on, or that they're stuck on.

32
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.220
In particular problems that
maybe touch on different teams.

33
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.070
So say the data science team can't
necessarily make a data pool that

34
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.430
they want because
the infrastructure isn't in place,

35
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.910
that's a good time to communicate
with the data engineering team.

36
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.050
And then what are their goals?

37
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.070
What's the steps that they wanna take?

38
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.700
It's also an opportunity to sort of peer
review of the progress that's going on.

39
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.180
So data science teams can
make presentations or

40
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.380
data engineering teams
can make presentations.

41
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.120
Everyone else can chip in, and
make comments and sort of evaluate.

42
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.180
So the key here is that you need
to set it up in such a way,

43
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.265
that people are empowered or
able to make criticism if they need to.

44
00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.660
They can make critical

45
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.980
comments about other people's
stuff without being rude or mean.

46
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.120
There's sort of a very fine line
to balance, and a lot of people

47
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.270
have difficulty with giving criticism
well or taking criticism well.

48
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.510
It's sort of up to the data science
team lead to make sure that,

49
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.170
especially when dealing with data,

50
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.470
to be very objective to allow people
to express their real opinions.

51
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.030
It's also an opportunity for you to set
team priorities and motivate people.

52
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.380
So, data science can
very often become a slog.

53
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.300
It's very hard to get all the details
right when you're doing an analysis or

54
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.220
setting up an infrastructure just right.

55
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.480
And, so
when you're sort of mired in the weeds,

56
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.240
it's very helpful to have somebody who can
come in and tell you the bigger picture.

57
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.270
Why are we doing this?

58
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.750
Why are we solving all these
really hard technically problems?

59
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.900
What's the goal that we're setting and
how do we get there?

60
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.580
And so that's your opportunity to sort of
motivate people, keep everybody excited,

61
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.930
keep everybody fresh on the problems that
you're working on at any given time.

62
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.030
So it's important to mix those two things.

63
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.100
To have individual meetings,
where each person can talk about what

64
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.710
is their personal issues that they need to
deal with or their own personal successes.

65
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.560
And also a group meeting where everybody
can kind of come together and communicate.

66
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.720
Your also in charge of
monitoring interactions.

67
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.790
So it's very common, if you sort of set
your data science team up in the way that

68
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.350
is sort of the most optimal.

69
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.349
In my opinion to have a data science
team that sits all by itself,

70
00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.729
that talks to each other and so forth.

71
00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:37.824
But then those people also in the data
science team spend some period of time

72
00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:39.620
embedded in other groups.

73
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.420
And so they interact with those groups,
they email those other groups, and

74
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.140
ideally each member of your team will
be responsible for interacting with

75
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.600
one particular external unit of
the organization that you're dealing with.

76
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.445
So it's your job to kind
of keep on top of that.

77
00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:55.580
It's to monitor how those interactions are
going and you can either do that actively,

78
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.630
by being CC'd on messages,
by being involved in the slack channel or

79
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.420
by going to those meetings
with the external folks.

80
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.750
Or you can do it sort of more passively,

81
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.350
sort of accept the feedback and hear it
from both the external organization and

82
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.430
from the person that
you've embedded there.

83
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.210
In either case, it's sort of up to
you to sort of monitor that and

84
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.780
make sure that
the communication is flowing.

85
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.520
That there's no break downs.

86
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.400
A very common thing is either for
communication to be to fast or to slow.

87
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.150
In a sense that if it's to slow, their not
getting enough details back and forth, and

88
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.430
the progress will slow down.

89
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.460
If it's to fast,

90
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.150
you might have an external unit that's
making extreme demands on data scientist.

91
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.720
That's very common too.

92
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.791
And so knowing how to sort of
modulate those sort of request and

93
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:38.512
take some of the heat for the data
sciences or data engineer that's getting

94
00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:41.485
those requests is something
that is up to the data manager.

95
00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:44.002
And so it's up to you to
sort of keep things running.

96
00:04:44.002 --> 00:04:48.027
And so the best way to do this in my
experience is with an open door policy.

97
00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:51.566
So generally it's good to have people
be able to come to you at anytime and

98
00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:55.047
not just at their weekly meeting or
their regular individual meeting or

99
00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:55.874
group meeting.

100
00:04:55.874 --> 00:04:58.565
Have them be able to like just drop by and
ask questions so

101
00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:00.920
that they can immediately get unstuck.

102
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.910
Again, some of these details
are things where people get stuck for

103
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.550
a long time on something they can easily
be solved if they talked to somebody else.

104
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.440
And so the best way to do that
is Is to have an open policy.

105
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.996
Another way is to have a policy to quickly
responding to questions via email or chat,

106
00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:19.620
especially if they're sort of things
that can be resolved very quickly.

107
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.690
You also want to be able to
like minimize the amount of

108
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.310
formal meetings that people have.

109
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.550
I mean there needs to be a regular
meeting so you can check on progress but

110
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.640
you don't wanna introduce
a large number of meetings.

111
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.080
Data science and data engineering
require large amounts of uninterrupted,

112
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.130
concentrated effort.

113
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.440
And so introducing too many meetings
into the lives of these people

114
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.340
means that they'll really
slow down their work.

115
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.734
And so, one way to do that is by allowing
quick communication that doesn't have to

116
00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:46.719
resolve into a formalized meeting.

117
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.780
It's also important to manage
the growth of the organization and

118
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.400
that's growth in a couple
of different ways.

119
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.270
Obviously it's growth in terms of the
number of people and how they're gonna be

120
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.810
managed in terms of how they can
communicate with each other and so forth.

121
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.610
But it's also good manage
the growth of individuals people.

122
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.480
Make sure that there is opportunities for
them to learn new tools.

123
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.770
Whether that's through giving them
access to courses online or otherwise.

124
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.320
Whether it's through presentations
in the group meeting,

125
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.440
where people present new ideas or
new tools that they've learned about so

126
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.460
other people can take advantage of them.

127
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.810
Whether its introductions
to new interactions.

128
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.940
So sometimes you'll be in meetings that
aren't necessarily the meetings that

129
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.050
your data science team is going to, but
you might identify an external group or

130
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.060
a person that really would make a good
connection with your data science team.

131
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.580
It's your job as the data science
manager to facilitate that interaction.

132
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.350
And then, a really critical component
of being a data science manager is, and

133
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.700
building a good data science team,

134
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.830
is identifying opportunities for
advancement for your people.

135
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.750
And so anytime that there's an opportunity
for your people to either get promoted or

136
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.510
to take on new responsibilities that will
look really good for them on their resume,

137
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.110
it's up to the data science manager
to sort of be on the lookout for

138
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.710
those opportunities.

139
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.280
Whether it's through new interactions.

140
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.300
Whether it's through
learning about new tools.

141
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.172
Or whether it's just ways in which they
can promote themselves both inside

142
00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:07.737
the organization and externally
at conferences or at meet-ups, or

143
00:07:07.737 --> 00:07:11.992
anything like that where they can actually
make more connections in their field.
