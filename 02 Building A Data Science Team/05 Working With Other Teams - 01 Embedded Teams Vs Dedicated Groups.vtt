00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.670
One of the questions that often comes
up when building a data science team,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.220
is whether you should build a stand-alone
data science group all on it's own, or

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.030
whether you should embed data scientists,

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.200
one in each of a number of different
external management organizations.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.420
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about
those two different scenarios.

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.395
In the embedded data scientist idea,
you're taking a data scientist, and

7
00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:25.555
you're having them sit with say,
the marketing team, or

8
00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:28.150
you're having them sit with the business
intelligence team, or you're having

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.970
them sit with a different team than
the rest of their data science colleagues.

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.140
So, there are some big advantages to this,
in particular,

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.740
they get to hear about the problems every
day that that organization is having.

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.380
It's a really great way
to promote collaboration.

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.696
It's also a little bit difficult in
the sense that they can't necessarily

14
00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:50.580
communicate very well with their own or
other data scientists.

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.680
They won't be able to ask questions if
they get stuck on different problems.

16
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.610
So there's some difficulties as well.

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.350
On the other hand,

18
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.120
you could imagine setting up
a independent data science group.

19
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420
So this depends a little bit on
the scale of your organization.

20
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.430
If you're a really small start-up
organization with only one or two people,

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.270
there's no need for a dedicated group.

22
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.040
But for a larger organization,

23
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.670
sometimes it makes sense to
have them all sit together.

24
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.310
The advantage here is that they'll be able
to ask questions quickly of their peers,

25
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.180
they'll have good support
among their peers.

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.086
The disadvantage is that they won't
necessarily be on top of all the problems

27
00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:25.450
that necessarily they need to be on
top of in order to do their job and

28
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.790
to effectively use data for
your organization.

29
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.220
So the keys when making this comparison
are communication, support, and

30
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.270
empowerment of data scientists.

31
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.330
So I'm gonna take each
of these one at a time.

32
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.360
So the first thing I wanted to
talk about is close communication.

33
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.450
So, the first thing that a data scientist
needs to do to be really effective is to

34
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.760
be working on a concrete problem.

35
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.720
And those concrete problems often don't
come out of the data science team,

36
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.020
they often come out of another team.

37
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.260
Whether that's the marketing team,
or whether that's the leadership, or

38
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.070
some other part of the company or
organization that you are working for.

39
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.280
And so to have close communication, one
option is to embed the person directly in

40
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.080
that external unit and
have them talk to them all the time.

41
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.210
But another way is to make sure that the
channels of communication are open between

42
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.270
people in the external units and
people in the data science team.

43
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.590
Either way, the key component is that
the data scientist should always be aware,

44
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.970
what's the concrete problem
they're trying to solve?

45
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.240
And when they come up with solutions,

46
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.750
they need to know what to benchmark
against, what's success look like?

47
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.120
And the best way to do that is through
communication with these external units.

48
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.280
The next thing is support.

49
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.970
You need to support data scientists, and
not only support data scientists, but

50
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.860
that way they have the support they need
to be able to help the other people in

51
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.310
your organization.

52
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.290
So if a data scientist is
embedded in an external unit,

53
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.350
often they don't necessarily have
the person that they can talk to.

54
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.340
It can be very frustrating
to perform data science.

55
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.690
A lot of it is very
low-level data cleaning,

56
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.450
which can be a very painful,
I can tell you from experience, process.

57
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.170
And so the idea is you wanna be able
to have somebody that they can turn to,

58
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.100
that they can talk to you for
advise or support.

59
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.280
So that often is better in
a stand-alone data science unit.

60
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.780
They can actually go and
talk to other people.

61
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.420
But again, then there can be this insular
nature of the group being on its own.

62
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.640
So the last thing is empowerment.

63
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.310
So one thing that's very difficult about
being a data scientist in the organization

64
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.250
is that the data often don't
tell you what you wanna hear.

65
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.980
So it's very common to
run an experiment and

66
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.390
to get a result that goes
against the common wisdom.

67
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.010
Or maybe you have a great idea, a great
hypothesis, you run an experiment, and

68
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.250
you collect the data.

69
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.160
It turns out your hypothesis was wrong.

70
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.940
Communicating these sorts of things
to the people that had the ideas or

71
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.540
the external units that came up with
those projects can be very difficult.

72
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.200
And in particular, if those organizations
are upset or the external units

73
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.220
are upset about the results that came
out of the data science experience,

74
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.300
the data science project,
there can be a big disadvantage because

75
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.150
the data scientists might be incentivized
to not tell you the full truth, or

76
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.220
to not communicate exactly what
happened in the experiment.

77
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.780
So we need to empower data scientists

78
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.380
to be able to be confident in
reporting the results that were there.

79
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.930
And then to have the organization support
that and make quick decisions, even when

80
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.370
those decisions are not necessarily
the way that everyone would want to work.

81
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.060
So it's not a political process,
doing data science.

82
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.010
And because it's not a politic process,

83
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.900
that can often make the politics
very difficult for data scientists.

84
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.470
So I've found that the best happy
medium between the two ways of working,

85
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.710
whether you embed somebody out externally,
or

86
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.790
you have a dedicated team, is to once
you're at a scale that's useful for it,

87
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.870
once you have two or three people that are
doing data science within an organization,

88
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.620
you have them sit together in a way that
they can all communicate with each other.

89
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.640
They can commiserate with each other, they
can empower each other to feel good about

90
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.070
the decisions they're making
about what to report.

91
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.080
But then you make sure that
they have close contact and

92
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.990
continual contact with those groups.

93
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.490
So they might go sit for
an hour a week with some group.

94
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.510
Or they might go sit for
a couple hours a week with another group.

95
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.790
But they always have a home
base to come back to,

96
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.530
the data science home base,
where they can feel really supported and

97
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.330
they can have the right people
to ask questions about.

98
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.057
So as long as you can encourage the right
kind of communication and make sure that,

99
00:05:06.057 --> 00:05:09.838
that doesn't become insular, that usually
tends to be the optimal arrangement,

100
00:05:09.838 --> 00:05:12.770
a dedicated team with close
connections to individual groups.

101
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.822
And ideally, you have each person has one
external unit that they are responsible

102
00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:19.992
for, or a small number of units
that they're responsible for,

103
00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:23.517
so that they can develop long-term
relationships with those units and

104
00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:27.007
really be effective at using data
to help optimize the organization.
