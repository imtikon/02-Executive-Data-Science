00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.080
So once you have a data science team, you
need to think about how that team is going

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.190
to interact with other teams
within your organization.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.100
So there a few different modes
under which that can happen,

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.900
and I'm just gonna talk
about each one of them and

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.320
how the data science team interacts
with outside people in that role.

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.340
So the first one I wanted to
talk about was consulting.

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.600
So consulting is an opportunity for

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.530
your team to collaborate with other
people where they come to you.

9
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.510
So they bring problems from outside
that they want to have solved,

10
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.540
whether it's maybe predicting how many
people will come to a certain website, or

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.820
identifying how many people
will click on an ad.

12
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.410
Or any other kind of problem that's based
in something that they're working on that

13
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.370
they think machine learning,
or prediction, or

14
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.120
inference would help them out with.

15
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.170
So that's a consulting model
where they sort of come to you.

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.478
Another option is that you
can have collaboration.

17
00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:50.370
So in collaboration, the data science
team will work sort of closely

18
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.000
hand in hand with one of your teams
to sort of build out a whole project.

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.040
And so in that case, it might be long-term
in the sense that you might have one

20
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.540
data scientist working with one external
team, say, the marketing team, for

21
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.800
a long period of time, or with one
collaborator for a long period of time.

22
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.640
And in that case, you often build
a sort of a deeper knowledge of

23
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.580
the exact function,
a role of that external person,

24
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.560
and so that can often help
in the data science process.

25
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.007
When you're talking about just a
consulting relationship, you only get sort

26
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.360
of a superficial idea about what's
the problem it is that you're solving.

27
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.184
And so
data science can still be useful, but

28
00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:26.143
it really doesn't have that deep dive
effect where the person actually

29
00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:29.260
has expertise in the area
that they're working on.

30
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.510
Another way that the data science team can
interact with the outside community at

31
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.490
your organization is through teaching.

32
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.490
So almost all data science organizations
can play a useful role by educating other

33
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.590
people about what data science is,
what data science can be used for.

34
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.210
How that team can actually
help benefit all the different

35
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.710
teams within the organization or

36
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.410
the other collaborative groups
within the organization.

37
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.449
And so a teaching role for a data science
unit is always a very helpful component.

38
00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:59.186
And so one way to do that is to organize
one-off events where you have a particular

39
00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:04.440
idea that's taught, say, how to visualize
data or how to interact with data.

40
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.680
Another is to have sort of a standing
teaching commitment where you have a sort

41
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.770
of a boot camp for people that come in.

42
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.040
How does data science help them?

43
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.010
So finally, you can have a data science
team be creative and propose new ideas and

44
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.118
actually move the organization forward.

45
00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:20.518
So there's an idea that
you could be data-driven,

46
00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:23.180
in a sense that you can go out and
collect data, and

47
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.670
make all of your decisions based on the
data wisdom that you collect from those.

48
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.390
But that actually falls a little
short of being able really make

49
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.780
transformative changes based on data.

50
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.835
In order to make transformative changes
with data, you need to propose new

51
00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:40.970
hypotheses and then test those hypotheses
and see if they actually work.

52
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.300
So it might be creating a new product and

53
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.000
then running experiments to
see if that product works.

54
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.050
Or might be predicting consumer behavior
or any kind of behavior that you're

55
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.868
interested in, based on machine learning,
in a new way, in a new application.

56
00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:59.290
Those sorts of creative ideas can
often come from the data science team,

57
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.870
particularly if they're involved in those
sort of close collaborative relationships

58
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.940
where they really understand what's
the problem we're trying to solve.

59
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.830
And maybe they have a new idea or
some new data that they can go collect,

60
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.840
either within your organization or
externally, to answer that question.

61
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.340
And so it's always great to give your
data science team a little bit of freedom

62
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.250
to be creative and
to come up with their own ideas.
