1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.110
It's not just the people in your
Data Science team that will want to

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.750
use data and interact with data.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.430
So part of your role as
Data Science manager, or

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.890
a Data Science executive is
teaching people how to use data or

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.800
empowering people to use
data within an organization.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.140
So one of the ways in which to do that
is through Data Science training.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.620
So there's a number of different
ways that you can do this.

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.140
One is pointing people to resources,
collecting and

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.310
curating resources that
are available online.

10
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.140
Whether that's online classes or online
materials related to sorts of things that

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.090
they might wanna be able to do.

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.190
It might be writing those
tutorials yourself, so

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.460
that people can interact with
the data themselves directly.

14
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.650
Another really useful way is to have
internal talks that are available to

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.640
everybody to go to if they want to.

16
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.950
Where the Data Science team communicates.

17
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.660
How do you pull data out of the database?

18
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.780
How do you make plots?

19
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.570
How do you visualize data
in a way that's compelling?

20
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.430
How do you do machine learning?

21
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.698
Or what is machine learning?

22
00:00:57.698 --> 00:01:01.589
Those internal talks are really useful
if they can also communicate what

23
00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.384
the internal capabilities are.

24
00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:07.289
One thing that's very difficult about Data
Science teams is that every Data Science

25
00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.946
team had different capabilities.

26
00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:13.712
Depending on the people that are there,
how subscribed their activities are,

27
00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:16.520
how difficult it is to do the problems.

28
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.466
And so communicating what's possible and
what's not possible in a way that's sort

29
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:24.930
of unbiased to the whole
organization often spurs new ideas.

30
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.130
New ways to take advantage of the Data
Science team to solve new problems

31
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.890
that people care about.

32
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.010
So you can either have sort
of training sessions or

33
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
sort of informational sessions about
how the Data Science team works.

34
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.670
Those are both really useful ways
to empower people to approach

35
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.200
the Data Science team and work with them.

36
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.470
Another way is to build documents or
build tools or

37
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.210
build products that can be
shared with other people.

38
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.910
Who don't necessarily have Data Science or
Data Engineering training, but

39
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.910
would like to interact with the data.

40
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.500
So one common example
is sort of a dashboard,

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.345
sort of a set of visualizations or
set of plots.

42
00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:02.430
That are built, so that somebody
can click on some buttons and

43
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.920
interact with that visualization.

44
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.720
They can ask their own questions,
have their own hypothesis and

45
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.890
interact with the data.

46
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.210
Even if it's just a subset of the data.

47
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.930
Another way is just one interactive
visualization can be really compelling,

48
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.390
can be a way for
people to sort of interact with the data,

49
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.120
ask one specific question.

50
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.100
And sort of see how their choices work.

51
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.370
So here the key is,
there's a design element to it.

52
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.710
It's how are you going to
design your interface so

53
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.340
that people can interact with the data.

54
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.050
They can ask their own questions.

55
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.316
But they're not intimidated by syntax or
knowing how to actually do the stuff.

56
00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:38.910
With the low-level programming
languages that you or

57
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.010
your Data Science team might know about.

58
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.620
So in addition to training,

59
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.380
there's these sort of ways to directly
connect people to the data themselves.

60
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.020
Ideally, you can automate this.

61
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.690
So a lot of report writing tools,
whether they're in sort of high Python

62
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.386
notebooks or shiny documents or so
forth, can be sort of auto-generated.

63
00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:02.190
You can also setup a dashboard that
does an auto-pull from your database,

64
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.600
that always has the latest and
freshest data available to people.

65
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.210
If you can automate it in that way,
the most common questions can be

66
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.860
answered by people other
than the Data Science team.

67
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.710
Which leads them to innovate and
to focus on new ideas and

68
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.330
new things that they can do well.

69
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.394
Or to shore up the infrastructure for this
sort of Data Science processes that you

70
00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:23.680
already have going on
in your organization.

71
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.914
The other thing that can be really useful
as a way to have people sort of interact

72
00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:32.060
with the Data Science team is with
Data Science idea evaluation.

73
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.200
So often people will have ideas about
ways they think they might be able to

74
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.330
use data that solve a particular
problem or another.

75
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.120
But it turns out that sometimes
those are impossible.

76
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.230
We don't have the right data or we don't
have the imaginary infrastructure,

77
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.040
we don't have the right scale to
be able to solve that problem.

78
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.020
But it's still really nice if you
can provide a way or a format or

79
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.590
a forum where people can propose ideas
that they'd like to do with the data and

80
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.410
get critical, but
positive feedback on those ideas.

81
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.840
You don't wanna immediately crush
any idea that somebody brings up.

82
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.570
You'll never hear another idea again.

83
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.230
But it is a good idea to sort of,
that helps tune expectations.

84
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.260
What can we actually do with
the datasets that we have?

85
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.080
Especially, if someone else
is proposing the ideas and

86
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.460
you are sort of letting them know.

87
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460
Yes, we can do that.

88
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.360
No, we can't do that.

89
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.180
Yes, we can do that, but

90
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.810
it would take a whole new
infrastructure on the server side.

91
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.700
Yes, we can do that, but

92
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.190
it would require us to develop a whole
new machine learning infrastructure here.

93
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.370
That gives people an idea about what's
going on with the Data Science team.

94
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.760
What can you actually do, what are the
parameters that makes it useful for you.

95
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.840
And so you can do peer review of
these ideas from the data team and

96
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.220
from yourself as another way to
interact with the organization.

97
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.655
But in general,
the idea is as often as possible drawing

98
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.340
other people into
the Data Science process.

99
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.260
Often that requires a little bit of
education and that education can feel like

100
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.545
wasted time if you're not thinking
about it in the right way.

101
00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:53.395
But if you think about it as
an investment in the future Data Science

102
00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:55.145
capabilities of your organization.

103
00:04:55.145 --> 00:05:00.395
It can be a really positive, really value
compounding way of doing data science.
