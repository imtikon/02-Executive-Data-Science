1
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.680
No matter how well you've put
the data science team together,

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.280
there can often be problems when the data
science team is interacting with people

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.180
outside of the team but
within your organization.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.060
So, this lecture's a little bit
about what those problems are and

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.760
how to deal with them.

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.910
So, the first one is lack of interaction.

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.730
So, this can happen if you,

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.740
especially if you have a data science
team that's stand alone, it's on its own.

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.070
And there's not necessarily a standing,
or regular commitment,

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.720
to be embedded it with, or
sitting with an external unit.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.060
So, here if there's a lack of interaction,
you have to identify what the problem is.

12
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.040
The problem can either be
with the data scientists.

13
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.650
They don't know how to contact the person.

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.228
They don't know what
questions to be asking or

15
00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:47.220
it could be with the external unit.

16
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.550
So, sometimes that lack of communication
is because there is nothing to do.

17
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.410
So, if there's no communication,
you need to identity,

18
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.460
is this because there's not actually
a problem for them to be solving.

19
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.200
In which case it's good to repurpose
that data scientist's time on to

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.029
a different project.

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.450
Or to identify, is it because the external
person isn't necessarily sending over,

22
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.300
hey, we need to have those
projections by the end of the week.

23
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.080
They're just not contacting
the data scientists.

24
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.750
Or is it because your data scientist is so
busy working on their problem,

25
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.190
that they're not interacting.

26
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.850
They're not emailing and contacting
the person that they're working with.

27
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.260
So again, this will depend a little
bit on the scale of the project.

28
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.950
If you're building a quick
machine learning algorithm,

29
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.960
there should be lots of quick interaction.

30
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.600
If you're building out a huge
scalable infrastructure for

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.270
data management, it might take
a little bit longer before there's

32
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.840
interaction with the leadership team
about that, and that's to be expected.

33
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.310
So if there's this lack of communication,
there's a couple of options.

34
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.750
You can take a more active role.

35
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.800
You can start initiating the conversation,

36
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.210
you can send emails that will
connect people together.

37
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.590
Again, you have to be very mindful of
the balance of not interrupting time for

38
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.510
data scientists and data engineers.

39
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.400
Those sort of uninterrupted moments
are when most of the work gets done.

40
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.130
And again, if you need to move personnel
from a project, whether it's for

41
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.660
lack of motivation,
lack of good communication, or

42
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.910
because there's not really a data science
project they're gonna be working on,

43
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.040
that's an important part of a data
science manager, or an executive's job.

44
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.470
Another reason that you might have to
get involved is lack of empowerment.

45
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.100
So this often happens if the data
scientist is actually embedded

46
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.720
in an external team.

47
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.230
And so, if that happens, often the data
scientist will feel a little bit

48
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.690
isolated and they might not feel
empowered to make decisions.

49
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.210
So the external unit is in charge.

50
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.920
They have to make some
decisions about marketing.

51
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.080
Or they have to make some decisions about
how they're gonna take that data and

52
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.160
make a decision for a product or so forth.

53
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.260
And since they don't necessarily
make those decisions,

54
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.660
they might feel like I keep
presenting my data ideas,

55
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.840
I keep showing them experimental results,
and they just don't listen.

56
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.280
They don't wanna answer to those data,

57
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.310
they don't wanna sort of use
the information that I'm presenting.

58
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.210
So the first thing that you need
to do is understand both sides,

59
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.000
cuz that can happen in one of two ways.

60
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.490
One, the person that they're working with,
the collaborator they're working with,

61
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.850
can just be ignoring their advice,
can be ignoring their data analysis.

62
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.890
In which case, it's up to you to
convince the other person, and to

63
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.810
sort of take the initiative to explain why
this is important, why using the data will

64
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.680
help you do a better experiment, will get
you better results at the end of the day.

65
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.520
On the other hand, it could be because
the data scientist is just sort of

66
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.640
pushing ideas beyond
the scope of the data, or

67
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.420
they're not getting the data analysis
done in a way that's convincing for

68
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.660
the external person to sort of look at and
interact with.

69
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.980
So you kind of have to
understand both sides.

70
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.630
And then, it's sort of up to the data
science manager to take the heat,

71
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.650
particularly in a situation where say,
leadership is asking for this machine

72
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.310
learning algorithm to be done last week,
and your data scientist is telling you,

73
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.160
well, it takes six weeks to build
a machine learning algorithm to do this.

74
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.750
Then, it's up to the data science
manager to collect that information,

75
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.520
present it, and

76
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.250
take the heat if things aren't going the
way that everybody hoped they will take.

77
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.820
So, one thing that's sort of a common
misconception about data science or

78
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.250
data engineering is that it's
basically instantaneous.

79
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.720
Because computers are so fast,
people think that also data science or

80
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.800
machine learning is
really fast to develop.

81
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.580
But sometimes it isn't.

82
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.490
Sometimes it takes a long time to build
a really good machine learning algorithm.

83
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.340
And so, part of your role is
sort of being the intermediate.

84
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.260
Being the explainer.

85
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.960
Why does it take so long?

86
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.290
And then providing internal
support to your data science team.

87
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.290
And whether that's just being an ear for
them to talk to.

88
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.600
Whether it's by suggesting new ideas.

89
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.260
And very often it's by
identifying when to stop.

90
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.680
So data science, data engineering and

91
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.910
data science are often areas where
perfect is the enemy of the very good.

92
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.635
Once you have a pretty good solution, that
might be enough to get everything done.

93
00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:38.245
And so, the data scientists or
data engineer,

94
00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:41.715
because they have pride in what
they're doing, will sort of try to

95
00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:45.495
optimize that machine learning
algorithm for the last 3% accuracy, or

96
00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:49.005
save at just a little bit more computing
power on the data engineering side.

97
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.595
Sometimes that's necessary,
but sometimes it isn't, and

98
00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:53.945
it's up to the data science manager
to sort of pay attention and

99
00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:58.400
manage when you're actually solving the
data science problem that matters versus

100
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.120
when you're chasing something that
doesn't maybe necessarily matter.

101
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.580
The last problem can be
lack of understanding.

102
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.680
So, this could be because
the data science team

103
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.040
doesn't understand the problem
that they're working on.

104
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.030
This commonly happens when data
scientist act in a consulting roll,

105
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.150
when they just one off, see people from
your organization, or bring one question,

106
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.880
how does this t test work, or
how does this random force work.

107
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.470
Then, they might not actually
understand the problem, and so

108
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.900
they might give advice
that isn't very good.

109
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.050
Another way that this could work is,
the marketing team doesn't understand what

110
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.530
data science can do, or the product team
doesn't understand what data science can

111
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.210
do, or any collaborator doesn't
understand what data science can do.

112
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.520
And so it's up to you to sort of help make
sure that everyone knows what's possible,

113
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.120
what's not possible.

114
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.520
And then, you can do this,

115
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.700
you can manage this process in
a couple of different ways.

116
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.180
One, make sure that, if you have
a separate dedicated data science team,

117
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.500
that they interact with other groups in
a regular way, that they're embedded for

118
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.130
periods of time.

119
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.120
Also, that there's presentations
regularly to the organization

120
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.510
both about capabilities and about new
techniques and about just what's going on.

121
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.410
And then advertising the data to
the science team within the organization.

122
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.310
Make sure that everyone knows, oh, that's
a problem that the data science team can

123
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.300
handle or actually we don't have any data
on that but it'd be cool to collect it.

124
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.520
Is that something that we
actually need to collect data on?

125
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.257
Those are the sorts of roles that can
help build a understanding within

126
00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:23.860
the organization about what data
science is and how it can help.

127
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.022
So those are a couple of the ways that
you could help minimize sort of external

128
00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:30.310
conflicts within the data science team.
