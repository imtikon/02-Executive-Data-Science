1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.140
So no matter how well you set up your
data science team, and no matter how nice

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.210
the personalities are, there will always
be some potential internal difficulties.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.950
Some of these are related to personalities
and interactions between people.

4
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.555
Some of them are related to
the way data scientists and

5
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.130
data engineers tend to work.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.440
So, it's up to you to sort of set up an
environment where these sorts of problems

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.170
are minimized and it's possible to sort
of keep the process moving as quickly and

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.110
as sort of friendly way as possible.

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.910
So the first thing they can often happen
is there can be interpersonal conflict.

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.050
Now this happens in any organization, but
obviously when you're dealing with sort of

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.070
heavily quantitative folks who often
are maybe a little bit introverted and

12
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.910
maybe have a little bit less interpersonal
interaction than people in other sort of

13
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.350
external units might have, you can
have some difficulties of interaction.

14
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.150
So I think it's very helpful to right
up front have a policy on the Code

15
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.220
of Conduct.

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.330
This policy can cover all sorts of things,

17
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.270
but it should definitely
cover all of the biggies.

18
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.600
Obviously you don't want to any
sort of put downs on the basis of

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.670
sexual orientation or on the basis
of race or on the basis of sex.

20
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.150
All that sort of thing can be
built into the policy, but

21
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.620
it can also cover more subtle things and
data science specific things.

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.600
So for example, if there's going to be
code review, if one person is gonna review

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.790
someone else's code, you might set up the
parameters for how that's gonna happen.

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.570
Are they going to make the suggestions?

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.620
Are they going to immediately submit
changes or fixes to people's code?

26
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.890
Are they gonna do that in a way where
they communicate with the person who

27
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.960
originally wrote the code or not?

28
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.500
When people are reviewing
each other's code and

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.250
in group meeting how are they
supposed to communicate?

30
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.020
Are they supposed to be critical?

31
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.450
How are they supposed to be impartial?

32
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.490
How are they supposed to
interact with each other?

33
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.330
Now this seems a little bit pedantic
to have these sorts of things set up in

34
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.170
advance, this sort of policy, but

35
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.720
it can really save you a lot
of trouble in the end run.

36
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.291
If you up front explain,
here are the exceptions for

37
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.650
how our organization is gonna run.

38
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.030
It also helps, in the data science
organization, like I said several times,

39
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.540
there's often uncomfortable truths
that you discover with data.

40
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.340
Whether it's something you
didn't quite expect or

41
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.800
a whether its a product or
a machine learning algorithm that failed.

42
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.770
And so having a Code of
Contact in place to prevent

43
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.420
personal hurt feelings Is
a critical component of this.

44
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.500
In that Code of Conduct it also makes
a lot of sense to explain what you mean by

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.910
success and failure.

46
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.110
So, if you only define success by
the machine learning algorithm works or

47
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.310
the software never has bugs in it or

48
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.550
the hardware never goes down,
there will be a lot of failure.

49
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.860
But if you define success
as identifying problems,

50
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.560
tackling those problems, and not always
getting an answer that everyone expects.

51
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.370
You kind of reduce the pressure on any
individual analysis, and that allows

52
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.180
people to act sort of more impartially,
really let the data speak for itself.

53
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.760
In addition to this policy you
need to have open communication.

54
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.480
Allow people to communicate directly
with you, and with each other,

55
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.970
about whether that policy
is being enforced.

56
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.900
And make sure that they feel empowered to
have that conversation with each other.

57
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.320
This is really critically important,
both in a general sense, but

58
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.050
also very specifically for data science.

59
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.620
It needs to be a policy that open
criticism of each others data analysis,

60
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.800
or other people's data infrastructure,
is accepted and embraced.

61
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.650
But at the same time, that criticism
isn't made to make people feel awful or

62
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.030
isn't used to hurt people, it's just
used to improve the entire process.

63
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.800
So that if you organize it in that way,
people will be open to criticism and

64
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.420
they'll be willing to sort of make
changes if they don't feel like

65
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.140
it's gonna hurt their job and
their job prospects.

66
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.880
The other thing is,

67
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.210
in the extreme circumstance where people
are not adhering to the Code of Conduct,

68
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.200
for either sort of general purpose reasons
or for data science specific reasons,

69
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.750
it's very useful to have outlined what
are the steps that are gonna take place.

70
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.150
What's the enforcement?

71
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.460
Whether it's something like,

72
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.010
I'm gonna point out when you're
behaving incorrectly in a code review.

73
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.940
Or whether it's something
like at a certain stage,

74
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.760
you'll be barred from coming to this
meeting for this period of time.

75
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.600
Whatever it is that you need to establish.

76
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.220
It's better to say it up front,

77
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.760
rather than to invent policies on the fly
when dealing with a data science team,

78
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.290
especially when you're dealing with
diverse people who have different

79
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.010
expertise, and maybe different
expectations about what's going on.

80
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.300
Another thing that you need to deal with,
or

81
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.610
another problem that often comes up
internally, is inter-meeting slowdowns.

82
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.360
So especially if you've established
regular individual meetings,

83
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.740
regular group meetings, you hope to see
progress at each of those meetings.

84
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.100
You hope to see problems getting solved or
at least tackled.

85
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.370
But sometimes that slows down,
and like I mentioned,

86
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.580
that can often be for
very trivial reasons.

87
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.780
There's a little bug in the code and
you just can't see it.

88
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.140
So you want somebody else to take a look
at your code and help you fix it and

89
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.800
get unstuck.

90
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.120
So the key here is to
identify the core issues.

91
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.180
What's the real problem?

92
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.370
Is it that the person
isn't self motivating?

93
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.820
Is it that they're not chasing,
they don't know where to go to look for

94
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.840
the right answers?

95
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.220
Is it that the interaction between the
data engineers and the data scientists, or

96
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.690
the data scientists and
the external people, it's not happening?

97
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.640
So you can either deal with that by
increasing your interaction, getting more

98
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.790
directly involved, emailing to ask
questions about how things are going.

99
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.890
That's sort of a delicate balance, because
like I mentioned, data scientists and

100
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.880
data engineers need long
periods of uninterrupted time

101
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.770
in order to actually solve these sort of
quite technical challenging problems.

102
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.470
It's also useful to sort of
check on people's motivation.

103
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.600
So you might have a data scientist who's
working with, say, the market team,

104
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.500
but they don't really like marketing.

105
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.010
They would much rather be
involved with a different team,

106
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.270
they'd rather be involved with product.

107
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.820
And they'd like to be building
data science products that can be

108
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.000
externally used.

109
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.920
And if you don't identify quickly
that their motivation is flogging,

110
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.540
it can be very hard for
the to get going again.

111
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.420
Given the frustrating
nature of data science and

112
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.590
data engineering for the people that
are doing it, motivation is critical.

113
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.610
So identifying and

114
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.100
fixing problems with motivation is one of
the key jobs of the data science manager.

115
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.000
So this is comes back to
the idea of frustration.

116
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.300
So, frustration is something that will
always come up with data science teams.

117
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.620
Both people externally being frustrated
with the data science team for

118
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.780
not getting the answer that they wanted,
and frustration internally

119
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.838
because the stupid software isn't
working the way you wanted it to.

120
00:06:09.838 --> 00:06:13.360
And so a way to fix that problem,
or to keep that problem going,

121
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.710
is to remember to use lots of
positive feedback whenever

122
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.830
success are there you
need to celebrate them.

123
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.900
Help people keep going,
keep being excited about coming in and

124
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.690
working on those data science problems.

125
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.370
But also impartial feedback.

126
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.106
So the key there is to talk about
the code, talk about the hardware,

127
00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:30.362
don't talk about the person.

128
00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:35.710
Always sort of focus on the problem and
how the problem's gonna be fixed.

129
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.710
And again, not to say that
problems are an issue that will

130
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.680
cause you to have difficulties
with your employment.

131
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.100
Like if If the machine learning algorithm
isn't working, that doesn't mean that

132
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.050
you're gonna be done, it means we're gonna
try another machine learning algorithm, or

133
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.010
we're gonna get a different data set, or
we're try to tackle a different problem.

134
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.630
That will keep people motivated and
not make them fear that if they don't do

135
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.010
the analysis in a certain way, they
won't be able to sort of keep their job.

136
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.955
So, motivation is a huge component of
keeping an internal data science team

137
00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:04.507
going.
