00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.870
Congratulations on finishing
Building Data Science Teams.

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.890
Good work.

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.910
So I wanted to let you know that there
are a couple of other resources for

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.860
you to check out, if you're interested.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.030
So first, there's a couple of great books.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.980
One is Data Driven,
Creating a Data Culture and

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.990
the second is Building Data Science Teams.

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.540
Both of these books talk a little bit
about how do you embed data science in

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.350
an organization, how do you build up
the team, what are some success stories,

10
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.520
what are things that work,
what are things that don't work?

11
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.210
So if you liked what you've
learned in this class and

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.990
you want to learn a little bit more,
there's a couple of great places to go.

13
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.060
I'd also encourage you to check out the
Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

14
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.770
So this is focused on, actually,
how do you do data science?

15
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.830
How do you do the data
analysis part of data science?

16
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.320
It's a sequence of nine classes.

17
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.840
It's a great place to go
learn a little bit more,

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.540
especially if you're going to be
managing a team of data scientists.

19
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.290
It'll really help you to
learn what are they doing?

20
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.930
What are all the terms they're using and
so forth?

21
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.928
And finally,
I'd encourage you to check out the rest of

22
00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:01.840
the John Hopkins Executive
Data Science Specialization.

23
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.310
We have some other great courses on how
do you manage the data science process?

24
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.090
What is data science?

25
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.095
What are the buzz words?

26
00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:10.880
And I think it will help you out a lot.

27
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.540
So anyway, it was great having
you in class and good luck.
