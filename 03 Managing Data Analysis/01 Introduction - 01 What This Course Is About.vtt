00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:07.560
Hi, I'm Roger Peng and
I'll be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.990
This course is about managing
the data analysis process.

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.450
Now data analysis is really hard because
it's a process that we don't understand

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.590
very well and
we have a difficult time describing,

6
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.200
even people who are really
good at analyzing data.

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.380
Maybe you're one of them, often have a
difficult time explaining exactly what it

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.070
is that they are doing, and the process,
the thought process that goes behind it.

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.930
Put it this way,
suppose you're a song writer,

10
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.470
and you're trying to write a hit song,
okay?

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.140
Now you have a lot of tools
at your disposal, but

12
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.920
you've probably heard a lot of
different songs that are really good.

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.660
So you kinda have a sense of what
makes it good, how long it should be,

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.430
what the structure should be in terms of
the verse and the chorus and the bridge.

15
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.230
We have a lot of music theory that tells
us what notes sound good together,

16
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.040
what notes don't sound good together, what
chords you should use, things like that.

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.630
There's all kinds of knowledge that we've
accumulated over the years about what

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.010
makes a great song.

19
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.990
But ultimately the song writer has to
inject this creative spark that puts

20
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.870
it all together and makes a piece of music
that people actually want to listen to.

21
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.996
Okay, so that's the art of song writing.

22
00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:18.850
In 1974, Donald Knuth,
a computer scientist at Stanford,

23
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.140
wrote an essay where he talked about the
difference between an art and a science.

24
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.040
And the bottom line is that he said
a science is something we understand so

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.690
well, that we can teach it to a computer.

26
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.270
Everything else is an art.

27
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.030
Okay.

28
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.400
So, one of the things that it's
important to understand for

29
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.190
this course,
is that data analysis is an art.

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.910
Okay, when you analyze data,
we have a lot of tools at our disposal.

31
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.760
We have statistical methods,
we have machine learning methods,

32
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.300
we have all kinds of software
packages that we can apply.

33
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.410
There are a lot of tools out there that we
have that have been developed by a lot of

34
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.160
different people in this area.

35
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.190
But ultimately, for a given data set,

36
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.840
it takes a person to put it together,
to ask the right question,

37
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.550
to assemble the right methods to interpret
the results, and to communicate them in

38
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.350
a way that people really care
about what you found, all right?

39
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.367
So that's kind of what this course is
about, is about managing this entire

40
00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.811
process and the iteration that you
go through to analyze data and

41
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:19.497
to produce coherent results.

42
00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:22.608
So I'm looking forward to working
with you in this course and

43
00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:25.174
to bring you through this
data analysis process.

44
00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:35.174
