00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:09.133
So the data analysis process for the most
part involves five different steps,

2
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.599
and these steps are basically stating and
refining your question, and

3
00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.438
exploring the data, and more importantly,
determining if the data that you

4
00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:23.525
have is appropriate for answering the
question that you asked in the first part.

5
00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:28.527
The third step is building statistical
models to summarize your data and

6
00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:31.320
to quantify the relationships.

7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.870
The fourth step is
interpreting the results, and

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.760
the fifth step is communicating those
results to the appropriate audience.

9
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.260
And each one of these five
steps you can imagine there's

10
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.320
a little cycle that you can engage in
which involves setting expectations,

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.170
collecting information, and matching those
expectations to the data that you collect.

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.189
And then revising your expectations
based on what you've seen.

13
00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.398
So what we're gonna talk about in future
lectures is how this little cycle,

14
00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:03.831
this three step cycle, applies to each
one of the five stages of data analysis.
