00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.722
There are six types of questions
you can ask in a data analysis, and

2
00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:06.828
in this lecture, we'll talk about
each of them and what they mean for

3
00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:08.180
interpreting your results.

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.510
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.037
The six types of questions that you can
ask in a data analysis are descriptive,

6
00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:23.770
exploratory, inferential,
predictive, causal, and mechanistic.

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.810
Now each one of these questions has
very different characteristics and

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.720
imply different ways that you can
interpret findings from any data analysis.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
So we're gonna talk about the
characteristics of each of these types of

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.980
questions and how they can be used or
misused in any data analysis.

11
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.290
The first type of question you can
ask is a descriptive question.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.070
Now, the fundamental feature of
a descriptive question is that

13
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.190
you're often looking to summarize a
characteristic of a dataset, so often this

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.780
involves taking the average or taking the
proportion of some feature in your data.

15
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.740
So for example,

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.900
you might ask how many people have visited
this website in the last 24 hours?

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.100
Or, you know, what's the average level of
air pollution in the city of Baltimore?

18
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.260
So here, you're summarizing kind
of the features of a dataset and

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.670
you're focusing on the data
that you have on hand.

20
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.920
And you're not really worried about things
that are outside of the dataset yet.

21
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.039
You really just want to summarize
the numbers that you have.

22
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.590
The second type of question you can
ask is an exploratory question.

23
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.538
And the basic goal here is
you want to look at trends or

24
00:01:24.538 --> 00:01:27.990
relationships between
variables in your data set.

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.300
Sometimes, these are called hypothesis
generating types of analysis because

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.520
you're looking at the dataset that
you have in hand and looking for

27
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760
relationships that might be of interest.

28
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.266
Again, like a descriptive question,
typically with an exploratory question,

29
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.161
you're not interested in things
that are outside the dataset, but

30
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.488
rather in summarizing and characterizing
relationships within a dataset.

31
00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:54.560
The third type of data analysis
question is an inferential question.

32
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.650
And an inferential question can often be
the result of lots of exploratory and

33
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.370
descriptive types of analyses.

34
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.670
And the fundamental property
of an inferential question

35
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.600
is that you wanna make a statement
about something outside the dataset.

36
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.411
And so you often, for example, you wanna
know whether a relationship that you

37
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:13.677
observe in the dataset
holds somewhere else.

38
00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:17.798
Either in another dataset or a different
population of kind of data points.

39
00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:22.796
And so, the key to an inferential question
is that you wanna make a statement about

40
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:25.650
something that you don't observe.

41
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.010
And so this is a much more difficult
type of question because now you're

42
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.430
concerned about things that
are outside the dataset.

43
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.441
And so you have to be careful
of what types of methods and

44
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:36.941
what types of approaches you use there.

45
00:02:39.163 --> 00:02:44.020
The fourth type of question in a data
analysis is a predictive question.

46
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.970
Now with a predictive question you
wanna know whether you can take a set

47
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.800
of features and use them to predict
another feature on a given person or

48
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.830
on a given unit of analysis, right.

49
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.530
So this is at a large scale about

50
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.050
essentially looking at correlations
between lots of features in a data set.

51
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.150
Now, often with predictive
types of questions,

52
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.940
they lead you to solutions that don’t
necessarily tell you how things work or

53
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.730
explain the mechanism of what’s
going on inside any given system.

54
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.150
Because the goal is to really produce
a very good prediction of a given feature,

55
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.090
given a set of other features, and

56
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.080
the goal is not really to
explain how things are working.

57
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.293
Now on occasion, a predictive question can
lead you to an explanation about what's

58
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:32.754
going on, but the key point here is
that it's not the ultimate goal.

59
00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:39.790
The fifth type of question that we're
interested in is a causal question.

60
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.460
Now with a causal question we're often
looking to determine how average

61
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.520
changes in a set of features or

62
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.290
in a given feature will change
when we modify another feature.

63
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.440
And so, if we take a variable and
deliberately make changes to it,

64
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.350
on average, how will another feature or
another characteristic be affected?

65
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.570
These types of questions can often be
directly addressed via experiment.

66
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.219
Such as randomized controlled trials,

67
00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.601
or directly controlled kind
of laboratory experiments.

68
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:14.548
However, in many other situations,
causal questions can really only be

69
00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:19.577
answered indirectly using observational
data, so in situations where we

70
00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:24.923
can't control what the settings are or
what the experiment or design a specific

71
00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:29.670
experiment to kind of to collect data,
on directly on this question.

72
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.864
And so, there in situations like that,

73
00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:36.060
we need to accumulate evidence through
many different types of studies, and

74
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.204
to develop a pattern that would suggest
that a causal relationship exists.

75
00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:47.215
The sixth type of question that we
are interested in is a mechanistic type of

76
00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:47.930
question.

77
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.660
And the goal here is essentially
to uncover a deterministic link

78
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.300
between two sets of features, okay?

79
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.530
And so we want to know if we can, if we
change one measurement on one hand, can

80
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.820
we, does it always result in a specific
outcome on a different measurement?

81
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.490
Okay?

82
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.980
Now this type of relationship is often
very difficult to identify outside of

83
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.220
highly controlled environments, for
example in engineering processes.

84
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.980
So we're often not, we're not often
gonna be looking at mechanistic types of

85
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.240
questions, but
it is an important area to think about.

86
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.050
Now why are we talking about
these six types of questions?

87
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.580
The reason is because knowing what
type of question you're asking is

88
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.880
really important to interpreting
the results of a data analysis.

89
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.180
It's often very common to mistake
one type of question for another.

90
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.910
And that will often result in
problems in your interpretation.

91
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.294
And on improperly weighting the evidence
from one kind of analysis versus another

92
00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:46.610
kind of analysis.

93
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.740
In fact it's so common to mistake
one type of question for another

94
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.520
that we actually have little nicknames for
when this type mistake occurs.

95
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.050
For example, we often think we're
asking a causal question, but

96
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.590
the way that we've done the analysis or

97
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.740
collected the data is really results
in us asking an inferential question,

98
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.950
and that is the classic correlation does
not imply causation type of problem.

99
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.960
Another good example is when we
think we're doing inferential,

100
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.260
we're asking an inferential
type of question.

101
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.030
But in reality we're doing
something more exploratory and so

102
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.990
that's sometimes called data dredging.

103
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.250
Another mistake that's commonly made is
when we think were trying to do prediction

104
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.250
but we build our prediction
models improperly and

105
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.190
so it ends up being more of
an exploratory type of analysis.

106
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.780
And that's something that's
called over fitting the data.

107
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.640
And lastly, we sometimes think that we're
doing an inferential type of analysis, but

108
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.940
it's really more descriptive, particularly
if you have very small sample sizes.

109
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.520
So, that's sometimes called
an n of one analysis.

110
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.550
So, make sure you know what type
of question you're asking, and

111
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.430
interpret your data
analysis appropriately.
