00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.195
This lecture is about the most
important part of a data analysis, and

2
00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:06.060
you don't even need a computer to do it.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.670
The first step for any data analysis
is pretty simple, you have to think.

4
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.350
So thinking is really important.

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.130
In fact, in most data analyses,

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.550
you should probably do more thinking
than doing of the data analysis.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.140
Because It will save you a lot of time and
a lot of money and

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.220
a lot of frustration if you just think a
little bit beforehand about what you want

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.570
to do before you start digging into
the data and digging into the details.

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.510
One of the most important things about
data analysis doesn't actually have to do

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.900
with the analysis itself, but it is
really important to ask a good question.

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.160
So in this lecture I was going
to talk a little bit about

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.440
what are the characteristics
of a good question.

14
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.830
So there's five characteristics
that I just want to highlight

15
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.000
about what makes for a good question.

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.190
So the first characteristic is that it
has to be of interest to your audience.

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.050
And now, the important part of this

18
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.500
feature is that you have to be able to
define who your audience is going to be.

19
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.780
So depending on who you are and
where you work and

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.160
what you're doing, your audience is
going to be a different set of people.

21
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.810
So, for example, if you're an academic
your audience might be collaborators,

22
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.160
they might be a scientific community,
they might be your funders or

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.590
the general public for your problem.

24
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.650
If you're working at a start up
your audience might be your boss or

25
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.350
the company leadership or investors or
maybe even potential customers.

26
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.820
So, knowing who your audience is and
knowing what questions are relevant to

27
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.410
them is a really important part
of asking the right question.

28
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.290
The second important part about
a good question that hasn't

29
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.620
already been answered already, so
this may seem a little bit obvious, but

30
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.450
with the wealth of data out there and
literature and

31
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.700
the availability of the Internet,
it's quite possible that someone,somewhere

32
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.420
out there, has either at least studied
your question or maybe even answered it.

33
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.660
So doing a simple search and looking to
see if your question has already been

34
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.260
answered, either inside or outside your
organization, can save you a lot of time

35
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.300
and money and allow you to ask the real
question that people want answered,

36
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.360
opposed to one that's
already been answered.

37
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.420
So it's helpful often to discuss your
question with experts in your area, or

38
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.940
maybe experts in your organization who
could help you to shape your question and

39
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.240
to ask one that actually
hasn't been answered before.

40
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.780
The third feature of a good
question is that it's plausible.

41
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.470
And the basic idea here, is that you
need to be able to have a reasonable

42
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.790
explanation for how the world works,

43
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.060
if the answer to your question is
kinda what you expect it to be.

44
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.970
In other words, you should be able to
explain the mechanism for how things work.

45
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.240
If you can't do this, then it's usually
a bad sign that it's not a great question.

46
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.480
And the problem with asking a question
that's not really plausible is that

47
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.930
it may lead you to collect some bad data.

48
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.657
In the sense that any analysis that you
do with the data might be difficult to

49
00:02:55.657 --> 00:02:56.367
interpret and

50
00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:59.880
may not really lead to strong evidence
about anything in particular.

51
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.954
And so and that may end up wasting
a lot of time, a lot of money for

52
00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:06.730
people if you've collected bad data
that question is not really plausible.

53
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.729
So before you go out and spend
the resources to conduct an experiment and

54
00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.325
do an analysis, try to think about your
questions, think about whether you could

55
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:19.410
explain how things would work if
you get the answer that you expect.

56
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.990
If you can't do that you may need to
refine your question a little bit.

57
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.630
The fourth feature is that the question
has to be answerable okay?

58
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.770
This is another one that
might seem a little obvious.

59
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.690
But the truth is there
are a lot of good questions,

60
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.540
really interesting questions,
that are just simply not answerable.

61
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.900
There may be many reasons why
a question can't be answered.

62
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.770
There may be ethical reasons
where you can't collect the data.

63
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.010
You might not have the money.

64
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.210
They might require too many resources
to try to answer a question.

65
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.680
And so, there's a lot of questions
that simply have to go unanswered.

66
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.330
For example, in health research, there are
a lot of questions that we have about how

67
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.810
the body works and how does disease occur,
but we simply cannot conduct

68
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.320
the experiments that we might like to
conduct because you might be putting

69
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.010
people in danger, or it might be simply
unethical to do such experiments.

70
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.560
So think about your questions
to see whether it's even

71
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.020
possible to answer it given the kind
of real-life situations that we are in.

72
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.580
Now, the last feature of a good
question is very important,

73
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.970
and it's that a good question
tends to be very specific.

74
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.900
Now, specificity is useful because it
often leads to simpler data collection and

75
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.100
simpler kind of experiments and
data analysis.

76
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.560
And so the key word here is sharpness.

77
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.600
You'd like to have a question
that's very sharp.

78
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.350
And that way you'll know whether the data

79
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.760
meets your expectations
about the question.

80
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.130
So a simple example might be,

81
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.590
you might wanna know whether a good
diet leads to better health, okay?

82
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.930
So that's a reasonable question.

83
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.910
People think that, you eat better,
your health will be better in general, but

84
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.960
it's not a very specific question, so
another version of that question might be,

85
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.820
if you eat five servings of fresh fruits
and vegetables per day, does that

86
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.030
lead to fewer respiratory tract infections
or, you know, colds, things like that?

87
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.730
So that's a much more specific question,
because I'm, instead of saying good diet,

88
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.760
I'm saying five servings of fruits and
vegetables per day.

89
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.920
And instead of saying, better health, I'm
saying fewer respiratory tract infections,

90
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.630
which is something very
specific that we can measure.

91
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.550
So, the important thing about
having a very specific question is

92
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.460
that it often can lead to a well
defined intervention, okay?

93
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.590
And by the intervention I mean
an action that you can take

94
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.480
given the answer to any
data analysis you might do.

95
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.960
So, if we collect the data on people
who have five servings of fruits and

96
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.820
vegetables per day, and

97
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.810
we collect data on how many respiratory
tract infections that they have.

98
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.280
If the data suggests that this
question is true, that more fruits and

99
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.780
vegetables leads to fewer respiratory
tract infections, then we already know how

100
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.350
we might intervene in terms of modifying
people's diets and improving their health.

101
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.760
So a very specific question will tend to
lead to a well defined intervention and

102
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.730
that will give you, those kinds of
results will allow you change behaviors,

103
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.560
to change actions to actually
make a difference in the world.

104
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.250
Whereas a very vague or non-specific
question will often leave you in the same

105
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.920
place that you started out in and without
knowing what kinds of changes to make or

106
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.500
what kinds of behaviors to change.

107
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.350
So just to summarize the five
features of a good question

108
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.560
are it has to be of
interest to an audience.

109
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.100
It has to not already been answered.

110
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.580
It has to plausible so that you can
kind of explain how things would work

111
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.080
if the answer to the question
met your expectation.

112
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.970
The question itself has to
be answerable in the real

113
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.020
world given all the constraints
that you might have on you.

114
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.020
And finally,
a good question is very specific so

115
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.760
that it can lead to a well defined
intervention in the world.
