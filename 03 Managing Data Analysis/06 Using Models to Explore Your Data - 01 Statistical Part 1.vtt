00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.170
Statistical models can play many
different roles in a data analysis.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.653
In this lecture I'll talk about how to use
statistical models to explore your data.

3
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:16.465
So exploratory data analysis
can have two broad goals.

4
00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:20.448
The first is more basic where it's you
determine whether you have the right data

5
00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:21.769
to answer your question.

6
00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.963
And part of exploratory analysis is to
determine do you need to get more data,

7
00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:29.834
do you need to change datasets, or
do you need to change your question or

8
00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:31.143
refine your question.

9
00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:35.273
So what I'm gonna talk about in this
lecture is really how do we develop

10
00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:40.034
a sketch of a solution to your question,
assume your question is appropriate and

11
00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:43.554
is answerable,
we want to start sketching out a solution.

12
00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:48.187
So in many ways this is
like with film-making,

13
00:00:48.187 --> 00:00:50.460
you want to make a rough
cut of your movie, right?

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.290
So the idea is it's not gonna
be the final product, but

15
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.670
it's gonna give you a sense of how
things flow and how things work.

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.060
And if you're gonna make an argument
to someone, you're gonna argue for

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.260
doing this versus that and you wanna
build evidence to make your case,

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.180
this is gonna be a basic sketch of
how that argument's gonna work out.

19
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.120
Okay?
So that's what we'll talk

20
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.580
about in this lecture.

21
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.600
And so this lecture is really
about using statistical models

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.400
to help you to summarize your data, and

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.120
to eventually kind of make things to
things like make inference, okay.

24
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.200
So the first thing we need to talk
about is what is a model, okay, and

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.090
why do we need them, okay.

26
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.370
So, models are generally speaking
are just constructs that we build

27
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.850
to help us understand the real world,
okay.

28
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.090
So for example, in biology often people
will use mice as models for humans.

29
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.490
So we can't do experiments on humans so
we'll use,

30
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.540
we sometimes people do
experiments on mice to use,

31
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.830
to kind of give us sense of what
might happen in a human being.

32
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.320
For example, for
things like drug development or whatever.

33
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.950
Now, so that's a very,
that's a physical type of model.

34
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.560
We're not going to be talking about
those kind of models of course.

35
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.930
But the models that we use
are mathematical models in many cases.

36
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.290
And we use them to help tell,

37
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.450
to kind of help us describe
the population that we're talking about.

38
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.560
So if there's a population out there that
we're trying to make inferences to, or

39
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.030
to describe in some way,
we use a model to kind of help us do that.

40
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.522
Because often the population is too
complex to think about all at once.

41
00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:20.010
So imagine if you're trying to make a
statement about the entire United States,

42
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.020
everyone in the United States, okay.

43
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.110
All the things that might go
on between all the 300 or so

44
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.210
million people in the United States,
it's impossible to think about.

45
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.180
So we need a model to
help us simplify that,

46
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.490
to allow us to think about it
in a kind of a reasonable way.

47
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.600
The ideas of the models will stand in for
the population.

48
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.930
And they're a much simpler form than
what might actually be going on

49
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.960
in the population.

50
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.540
But they represent population features and
relationships, okay.

51
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.900
And the models help us by imposing
structure on the population, so

52
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.250
we might for example assume that things
are linearly related to each other.

53
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.220
We don't necessarily know that, but

54
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.780
it helps us to simplify how we think about
two different variables in the population.

55
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.684
And the important thing to realize, and

56
00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.210
this is a well worn saying
in the field of statistics.

57
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.750
Is that, all models are wrong,
but some are useful.

58
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.170
So, it's important not to get hung
up on finding the right model.

59
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.740
But rather to focus on developing
a model that's actually useful

60
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.490
to help you tell your story
about the population.

61
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.060
So it might be useful
to start at this point,

62
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.880
which I think it was to ask what's
it like to have no model at all?

63
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.580
Okay.

64
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.210
So that way you get a sense of
kind of how bad things can be or

65
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.030
how difficult it might be if
you didn't ever use a model.

66
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.600
Okay.

67
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.280
So just take this as a basic example.

68
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.710
Suppose you're developing a new product,
and

69
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.110
you want to know how much people would
be willing to pay for this new product.

70
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.950
So something you might do is
just put out a simple survey,

71
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.590
you might survey 20 people, and
that may be a representative

72
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.330
of the the larger population of people
that would be willing to buy this product.

73
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.570
And ask them how much they
would be willing to pay.

74
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.440
And so you do the survey and
then someone comes at you and says,

75
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.150
okay well what did the data say?

76
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150
Okay, what did they tell us?

77
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.190
Now so as an example, I recently
published a book called R Programming for

78
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.760
Data Science.

79
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.339
And before it was published,
on the website,

80
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.043
you could ask people to put their names,
their email addresses and

81
00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:24.433
ask them how much they'd be willing to
pay for this book before it goes on sale.

82
00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:26.777
And so here's what the data looked like.

83
00:04:26.777 --> 00:04:31.053
So these are 20 numbers from
the survey that was put out on

84
00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:33.594
the website about my book, okay?

85
00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:36.276
So this is life without a model, okay?

86
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.200
The answer to what did the data tell us.

87
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.900
It's in here somewhere,
because this is the data.

88
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.580
It has to be in here somewhere.

89
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.160
But the problem is, so this is, there's
no model to help us think about the data.

90
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.860
So this is what I would call the trivial
model, meaning that there's no model.

91
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.550
Okay?

92
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.470
And the problem is the trivial
model is not useful.

93
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.415
Because it doesn't provide any summary or
any data reduction.

94
00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:59.420
Okay?
So put it this way, if all models

95
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.200
are gonna be wrong, you might as well
try to find something that's useful.

96
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.125
Rather than have no model at all that's
almost certainly not going to be useful.

97
00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:09.105
All right?

98
00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:11.795
So just for the sake of example,
let's use the normal model.

99
00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:15.125
So, the normal model is based
on the normal distribution, and

100
00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:18.055
it's the familiar bell curve that
we've seen many, many times.

101
00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:18.920
Okay?

102
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.550
The nice thing about the normal
model is that it only requires

103
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.700
two parameters to estimate.

104
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.810
There's the mean, and
the standard deviation, okay?

105
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.470
And we can estimate that from the data
by just calculating the mean and

106
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.050
the standard deviation in the usual way.

107
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.660
So the first question we want to ask is,
what do we expect to see?

108
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.220
If the population were truly
coming from a normal distribution,

109
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.350
what would that look like, okay?

110
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.590
And it's always important
to set expectations for

111
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.210
models, so I know it's very tempting
to get right into the data and

112
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.430
see what they look like, but you gotta
be able to set your expectations.

113
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.820
Appropriately, so that you know whether
you're right or wrong in the end, okay?

114
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.420
So here's what we would expect the data
to look like if they were drawn from,

115
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.920
as representative samples
from the population

116
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.580
that was governed by
a normal distribution.

117
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.950
So here's the normal curve.

118
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.830
It probably looks very familiar to you.

119
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.140
Now models are very useful,

120
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.520
because they can tell us a lot of
different things about the population.

121
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.130
For example, this model, the normal model,

122
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.510
says that 68% of the population of readers
would be willing to pay between $6 and

123
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.600
81 cents, and $27 and 59 cents,
okay, how do we know that?

124
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.470
Because that's what the normal
distribution based on this data set

125
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.920
tells us about the population, okay?

126
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.140
We can use the models to compute other
quantities too, for example we might want

127
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.330
to know how many people will be
willing to pay more than $30.

128
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.700
So we can use the normal
distribution to say that 11% of

129
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.410
the population would be
willing to pay more than 30.

130
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.670
So that's useful to know.

131
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.210
Now, the one thing about this picture
that you have to just remember

132
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.370
is that there is no data in this picture.

133
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.840
Now we use the data to draw the picture,

134
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.350
because we use the data to calculate
the mean and the standard deviation.

135
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.947
But there's no actual
data in this picture.

136
00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:58.270
So just keep that in mind.

137
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.840
Now, but
eventually we'll look at the data.

138
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.320
And we want to know how that
data matches our expectation,

139
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.750
which is what this picture is giving us.

140
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.930
Now before we actually get to the data,
one of the things I just want to do is to

141
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.310
show you, what would data look like if it
came from a normal distribution, okay?

142
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.890
Now the nice thing about most software
packages now is that we could just

143
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.560
simulate the error from a normal
distribution and see what it looks like.

144
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.490
So here's what that picture looks like.

145
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.460
I've made a histogram of 20
data points that come from

146
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.730
exactly a normal distribution.

147
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.230
And I plotted the theoretical
normal curve over.

148
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.790
You can see that the histogram and

149
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.880
the blue curve match very
nicely with each other.

150
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.550
This is all very nice and
ideal because it's simulated, okay?

151
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.040
So this is what I call,
drawing a fake picture, okay?

152
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.980
Drawing a fake picture I
find to be terribly useful

153
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.520
because it really helps
to set expectations.

154
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.322
And sometimes its okay to even
literally just draw it with your hand.

155
00:07:48.322 --> 00:07:50.528
You don't have to
necessarily use a computer.

156
00:07:50.528 --> 00:07:55.028
But draw a fake picture of what
you're expecting to see with

157
00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:57.290
the actual data okay?

158
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.010
So this is what normal data looks like,

159
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.220
if we see a histogram it
kinda looks like this.

160
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.560
We might think okay a normal distribution
is a pretty reasonable approximation for

161
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.140
the dataset okay?

162
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.290
So, now one thing that we can
see from the fake picture

163
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.250
is that the normal distribution probably
isn't going to be perfect from the get-go.

164
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.990
Because in particularly you can
see on the left-hand side there

165
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.545
that there are negative values, okay?

166
00:08:19.545 --> 00:08:22.510
[LAUGH] And it doesn't seem plausible

167
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:27.260
that people would be willing to pay
negative dollars for this book.

168
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.300
And so maybe that's probably not the best
model, but it may be still useful.

169
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.860
Remember that no model is
going to be right, but

170
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.270
it may actually still be useful for
helping us summarize the data.

171
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.055
Okay, so here's what the data
actually looked like, okay?

172
00:08:39.055 --> 00:08:45.045
I've got a histogram of all of the data
points that were from the survey.

173
00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:46.545
This is 20 data points.

174
00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:49.035
And I've overlaid it with the blue curve,
the normal distribution,

175
00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:50.515
that's fitted to the data.

176
00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:53.442
So you have to ask yourself
how does the data match

177
00:08:53.442 --> 00:08:56.622
up with this normal distribution,
with this model, okay?

178
00:08:56.622 --> 00:09:00.162
Now, given what we've seen before
with the theoretical normal curve,

179
00:09:00.162 --> 00:09:02.972
with the fake data and
the fake picture that we showed,

180
00:09:02.972 --> 00:09:06.032
how does this picture compare
to the fake picture, okay?

181
00:09:07.052 --> 00:09:10.642
Now, you might think it doesn't look
that good, actually, [LAUGH] right?

182
00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:12.292
So what's wrong with this picture?

183
00:09:12.292 --> 00:09:17.400
Well, you got this huge spike in
the histogram at around $10, okay?

184
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.830
That's not predicted by the volume,

185
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.160
the normal distribution doesn't have
a huge spike right there, and furthermore,

186
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.750
there are no values that are either close
to zero or negative, whereas the normal

187
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:32.780
distribution has all these negative
values in its functional form.

188
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.190
So it doesn't look like
the histogram really fits that well.

189
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.940
So what are we going to do about that?

190
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.540
So there may be multiple problems.

191
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.200
There may be multiple explanations for
why the histogram from the data

192
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.520
doesn't look like what we'd expect
from a normal distribution.

193
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.920
For starters, the data may not even
be representative of the population.

194
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.550
This is just a website that was up there
and anyone who just happened to come by

195
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.460
could fill in their name and
say what price they'd be willing to pay.

196
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.820
Who knows who these people were, who knows
if they were even prospective customers,

197
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.890
people who would actually buy the product?

198
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.730
So that the data collection process
might have been very skewed.

199
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.890
We have no real way of knowing that.

200
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.360
But on the other hand it could be that the
model clearly just does not fit well and

201
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.550
we may need to revise the model too.

202
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.900
It may be easier in some circumstances to
revise the model than to revise the data,

203
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.245
especially at the data collection process.

204
00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.175
Is very expensive, okay?

205
00:10:23.175 --> 00:10:26.315
So one of the things we can do is
let's try the gamma distribution.

206
00:10:26.315 --> 00:10:29.185
Okay, so the gamma distribution
is another model and

207
00:10:29.185 --> 00:10:32.495
one of its key features is that it
only allows for positive values.

208
00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:35.207
So unlike the normal which has
negative and positive values.

209
00:10:35.207 --> 00:10:38.627
The gamma distribution only
allows positive values.

210
00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:41.437
So then we can just repeat all the steps
that we just went right through.

211
00:10:41.437 --> 00:10:42.627
We can set expectations.

212
00:10:42.627 --> 00:10:47.557
We can draw a fake picture and then we
can compare our expectations to the data.

213
00:10:47.557 --> 00:10:48.110
Okay.

214
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.060
So, I'll skip the first two steps there,
and I'll just show you,

215
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.050
here's what the picture
looks like with the data,

216
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.790
and the gamma distribution that's
fitted on top of it, okay?

217
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.870
So you can see from this picture that
the fit's not perfect either, okay?

218
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.780
Maybe, you could argue
it's a little bit better,

219
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.040
you've got a little hump
wherever that spike at ten is.

220
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.830
But it's not, it doesnt exactly fit it
perfectly, and still you have a bunch of,

221
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:15.040
the curve, is kind of covering values
where there's no data between the zero and

222
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.370
five range.

223
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.226
And now, but the important thing is
that we have a different model, and so

224
00:11:19.226 --> 00:11:22.470
a different model is gonna
yield different predictions.

225
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.058
So this model is telling us something
completely different about the population

226
00:11:26.058 --> 00:11:27.650
than the normal model was, right?

227
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.090
So the normal model told us there was
gonna be a big hump kind of around 20.

228
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.780
But this model tells us that the hump's
more like around seven and ten.

229
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.470
Okay?

230
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.740
So the model is telling us something very
different about what the population is

231
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.890
willing to pay for this product.

232
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:42.800
Okay?

233
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.790
For example,

234
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.640
before we said that 11% of people
would be willing to pay more than $30.

235
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.100
However, if we use the gamma model

236
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.100
we find that only 7% of people would
be willing to pay more than $30.

237
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.610
So the importance of using models,
different types of models is that

238
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.220
they tell you very different
things about the population, and

239
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.350
they result in very different predictions.

240
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.370
And so, if you're interested in
making these predictions and

241
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.850
being accurate about them, you want
to make sure you have a model that's

242
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.670
reasonably a reasonable
approximation of the population.

243
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.330
And you can use the data to
help you see if that fits well.

244
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.370
Now we have looked at two
different types of models

245
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:26.220
to tell us about our data and
to tell us about the population, okay?

246
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.290
So now you may want to keep, continue to
refine this, think about different models.

247
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.290
Obviously this last one didn't really
fit perfectly, so you might wanna

248
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.550
either refine your model or you might want
to do another survey to get more data,

249
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:41.020
to get a better sense and so you kind
of think about where you go from here.

250
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.350
The point of this whole exercise
is that you get a little sketch

251
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.000
of where you're gonna go and
kinda what your solution's gonna be.

252
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.100
If your question was originally,
how much are people willing to pay for

253
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.500
this product,
you have a better sense now in terms of

254
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.180
what the shape of that
distribution might look like.

255
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.350
And what the population
might be willing to do.

256
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.190
From here where you go, it depends.

257
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.750
You may have enough information
as it is to kind of set prices or

258
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.390
to figure out how your
marketing campaign's gonna go.

259
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.550
Or you might want to go
into more formal modeling.

260
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.990
So you can test the sensitivity
of your assumptions,

261
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.470
of your expectations to various features.

262
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.997
So that's what we'll talk about more
when we talk about formal modeling.
