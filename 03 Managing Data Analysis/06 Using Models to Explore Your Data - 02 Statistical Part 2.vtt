00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.765
This lecture's just another quick example
of how to use statistical models to

2
00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:06.300
explore your data and
to develop a sketch of your solution.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.303
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:15.260
So this example looks at fitting
linear models to some data.

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.670
And the data that we're
gonna use is ozone and

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.380
temperature data from New York City for
the year 1999.

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.350
This data comes from
the National Morbidity and

8
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.010
Mortality Air Pollution Study which is
an Air Pollution Study that I was heavily

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.260
involved with.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.540
So the data that we've got here is
just daily levels of 24 hour average

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.950
temperature and 24 hour average ozone
levels for the year 1999 in New York.

12
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.910
And the basic question that
we're interested in asking here

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.680
is how our ambient temperature levels

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.130
related to ambient ozone
levels in New York City, okay?

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.430
Now, just a couple things
about how ozone works.

16
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.380
First of all,
the development of ozone in the air

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.030
depends a lot on the amount
of sunlight that's available.

18
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.910
So, days with lots of sunlight
have higher temperatures

19
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.300
than otherwise similar days
with lower temperatures.

20
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.480
And so, similarly, cloudy days tend to
have lower temperature and less ozone.

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.000
So the basic idea is that we expect days

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.820
with higher temperature to
have higher ozone levels.

23
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.840
But this is kind of
an indirect relationship.

24
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.690
What we're really doing is we're
using temperature as a proxy for

25
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.670
the amount of sunlight that's available,

26
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.240
cuz we don't really actually
have any data on sunlight, okay?

27
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.350
So we're expecting this kind of positive
correlation between temperature and

28
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.630
ozone in New York City.

29
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.550
Now the simplest model that we can use to

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.100
describe this relationship that
we expect is a linear model.

31
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.200
So now the question we should
be asking right now is,

32
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.060
what does a linear model look like?

33
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.420
So remember we wanna set expectations
before we start looking at the data.

34
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.909
So the easiest way to do that
is to draw a fake picture.

35
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.130
So this picture shows two simulated
variables with a linear relationship.

36
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.670
Okay?
There's no actual data here.

37
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.290
We just simulated it on the computer.

38
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.740
So you can see that the data
increased from the left to the right,

39
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.190
like a line but
with some scatter around it.

40
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.830
And, furthermore, if you choose any point
on the blue line, there are roughly

41
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.410
the same number of points above the line
as there are below it, all right?

42
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.880
So we think of the line as
being kind of unbiased, right?

43
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.740
So if there's gonna be a deviation
from the line it's equally likely to

44
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.140
be above or below it.

45
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.700
So this is the picture that we expect
to see when we look at the data.

46
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.350
So it's important that we kind of set
these expectations before we look at

47
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.740
the data, so we know whether we are kind
of right, or wrong, or far off,

48
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.300
or pretty close to the mark.

49
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.100
So here's the actually data for

50
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.780
New York in 1999, with a fitted linear
regression line overlaid on top, okay.

51
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.710
So the first question you wanna ask
yourself is how does it compare

52
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.520
to what we are expecting from
the previous picture, okay.

53
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.410
Now one thing that we can
see is that temperature and

54
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.020
ozone are in fact increasing together.

55
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.960
When temperature is higher,
ozone does tend to be higher.

56
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.210
And when temperature is lower,
ozone tends to be lower.

57
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.020
But there are some deviations
from what we might expect

58
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.340
from what we saw in the previous picture.

59
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.580
In particular, if you look at
around 85 degrees in temperature,

60
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.770
you look at where the blue
line is around that point,

61
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.150
you'll see that most of the data points
happen to be above the line, okay?

62
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.040
There aren't many data points below
the line, right around that neighborhood.

63
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.480
Then again, if you look at the temperature
70 degrees and where the blue line

64
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.720
is there, you'll see that most of
the points are below the line, actually.

65
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.810
And there aren't that many
points above the line.

66
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.770
So, at around 85 degrees, what we see
is that the blue line, our model,

67
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.048
the linear model,
is kind of biased downwards.

68
00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:32.640
And at 70 degree point mark the linear
model is actually biased upwards.

69
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.920
We're tending to predict too high for
what the ozone level actually is.

70
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.450
So what we see here is that the model
kind of captures the general

71
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.000
trend of kind of increasing
temperature and increasing ozone, but

72
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.280
it tends to be biased within
certain ranges of temperature.

73
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.157
So it's clearly not a perfect model.

74
00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:53.527
So the observed pattern from the data
seems to suggest that the relationship

75
00:03:53.527 --> 00:03:57.486
between ozone and temperature is
actually kind of flat up until about

76
00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:00.988
the point where you hit 70 degrees,
72, 73 degrees.

77
00:04:00.988 --> 00:04:05.721
Then there's a sharp increase
in ozone with every additional

78
00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:08.120
degree of temperature.

79
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.130
And so this suggests that maybe
the relationship is non linear.

80
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.820
Okay.

81
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.210
So we can revise our expectations for

82
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.690
what the relationship should look like to
be this kind of non-linear relationship,

83
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.570
rather than our original expectation
of a linear relationship.

84
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.980
And so the way that we can check that
is by using a non-linear smoother.

85
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.866
Here's some data with a low-S smoother,
which is a flexible smoother that can

86
00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:30.714
capture a lot of different
kinds of smooth trends, okay.

87
00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:35.505
So what we can see here is that, from
the blue line, there's a sharp increase in

88
00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:40.012
ozone after about 75 degrees, and
then maybe around 85 degrees or so,

89
00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:44.620
there's some suggestion of
leveling off of the relationship.

90
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.370
So there's a suggestion of a classic
kind of S-shaped curve here,

91
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.740
where there's a kind of
roughly flat relationship,

92
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.509
then there's a sharp, increasing one and
then kind of leveling off.

93
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.580
Now, these smoothers like low S are very
useful for capturing these kinds of null

94
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.060
in your trends but they usually don't tell
you much about how things work underneath.

95
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.100
So we may wanna revise our original
linear model based on what we found here

96
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.509
to think,
to try to capture these trends and

97
00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.264
to learn more about what's
going on underneath.
