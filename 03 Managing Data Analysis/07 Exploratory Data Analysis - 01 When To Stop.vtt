00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.060
Exploratory data analysis is
a highly iterative process.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.660
But it's tempting to want
to iterate it forever.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.948
This lecture talks about
when to stop the process and

4
00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:10.830
move on to the next
phase of data analysis.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.179
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.700
So far the examples in these lectures

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.570
have generally illustrated one
phase of the EDA iteration.

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.720
But most exploratory data analyses iterate
for a couple of times as you go through

9
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.790
and you revise the question or
update the data or change your model.

10
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.620
And usually, every new answer that
you get will raise more questions.

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.980
So it's possible to just
kind of go on forever.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
Now, but the real question is when do you
stop, because none of us live forever.

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.650
We have to eventually figure out
what the answer's going to be and

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.920
move onto the next phase.

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.380
This lecture just raises a couple of
questions that you can ask yourself

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.870
to figure out when it's time to stop.

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.410
So, the first question is
really are you out of data?

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.940
So eventually, as you iterate through the
exploratory data analysis, you may be led

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.560
to a place where you simply don't have
any more data to answer the questions.

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.950
So you can't move forward.

21
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.240
So for example in the example about the
ozone and temperature relationship, one

22
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.830
of the things that we discovered was that
the relationship appeared to be nonlinear.

23
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.890
But what the data doesn't tell you is why
that relationship might be nonlinear.

24
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.520
Or how it might manifest in that way.

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.650
And so the data might suggest certain
hypotheses that you can further explore.

26
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.470
But eventually you'll need to go out and

27
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.520
collect more data on things that
you haven't already measured.

28
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.160
So, now if the analysis is successful and

29
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.590
you've answered the question
that you've set out to ask.

30
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.780
That's another indicator that
you're probably out of data.

31
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.410
Because often what
you'll want to do is get

32
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.840
another data set to
replicate what you've done.

33
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.290
Okay?
So if you've answered the question and

34
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.150
maybe it's matched your expectations,
it's often important

35
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.080
to try to replicate your findings
in an independent data set just so

36
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.340
you can be sure that the answer that
you've come to is actually the truth.

37
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.420
So this is a sign that you're out of
data and you need to get some more.

38
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.790
The next question that you might want to
ask yourself is do you have enough data

39
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070
to make a decision?

40
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.610
Now data analysis is often done in
support of some sort of decision making.

41
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.250
Okay?

42
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.830
And analysis for decisions is often
different from doing analysis for

43
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.520
like supporting a research paper,
or for shipping a product, or

44
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.620
even if you're writing a technical report.

45
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.070
It may be that you have
enough information or

46
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.605
you have enough evidence to make
a decision based on lots of external

47
00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.705
factors that are not really
in the data set, okay.

48
00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:40.175
So decision making can depend
on many different inputs.

49
00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:42.295
One of which may be your analysis.

50
00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:46.382
So, keeping in mind the purpose of
a data analysis is very important.

51
00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:51.122
Cuz if you don't keep in mind the exact
purpose of why you're analyzing the data,

52
00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:54.592
you may over or
under invest resources into your project.

53
00:02:54.592 --> 00:02:57.762
And so, and finally, the purpose of
your analysis may change over time.

54
00:02:57.762 --> 00:02:59.061
This is fairly common.

55
00:02:59.061 --> 00:03:02.491
And there may be multiple
parallel purposes all at once.

56
00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:05.051
And so, keeping track of
what these purposes are and

57
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.561
why you're analyzing data will keep you
focused on how much you can iterate your

58
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.361
data analysis to get
the appropriate answer.

59
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:14.271
The next question you
wanna ask yourself is,

60
00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:17.381
can you place your results
in a larger context?

61
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.090
Another way to ask this question is
really, do the results make any sense?

62
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.600
Because now,
in order to answer this question,

63
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.969
you may need to search the literature,
or talk to people inside or

64
00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.156
outside your organization who
are familiar with this area and

65
00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:33.050
to see if your findings fit
with what they expect to see.

66
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.283
Now whether your findings do fit
the kind of existing literature or

67
00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.727
what people believe.

68
00:03:38.727 --> 00:03:41.520
It may or may not be a good thing.

69
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.360
If they don't fit, for example, this may
lead you down a path of new discovery.

70
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.600
So it could be a good thing if you
find something that's unexpected.

71
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.380
Now on the other hand if you do find
something that is expected, and

72
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.000
your findings kind of match
what everyone is looking for.

73
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.890
That may or
may not be a good thing either.

74
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.580
Now in particular,
if your data match your expectations

75
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.785
it may simply be an indication that you
have a question that's not very sharp.

76
00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:08.195
If you have a question that's
kinda vague in its nature,

77
00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:11.055
then there may be a lot of
different patterns in the data

78
00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:15.455
that match those expectations
that are raised by your question.

79
00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:19.175
If you find things that kind of make sense
to you, it may be an indication that you

80
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.265
actually need to sharpen
your question a little bit,

81
00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:22.735
to make it a little bit more precise.

82
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.710
Now if the results don't
match what you're expecting,

83
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.950
this may be an interesting thing, but
it definitely needs to be followed up.

84
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.720
Because remember for every diamond in
the rough, there are 99 pieces of coal.

85
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.150
So it could be that you just made a simple
mistake, and you need to check for this.

86
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.001
So really actually, no matter what, no
matter how you answer the question of do

87
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:48.028
these results make sense, the thing that
you need to do is check what you've done,

88
00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:51.010
check it over to make sure
there's no simple mistakes.

89
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.380
And if you don't find any mistakes
the other thing that you might want to do

90
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.950
is to try to replicate it
in an independent data set.

91
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.749
And so if you can replicate your findings,
and then regardless of whether

92
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:05.101
they matched your original expectations,
you can have a little bit more confidence

93
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:08.429
in the fact that whatever you
found could actually be the truth.

94
00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:12.580
The last question you can ask yourself
is really are you out of time?

95
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.600
Now, this sounds arbitrary.

96
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.650
But it's a very realistic question.

97
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.820
Another way to ask this question really,
is are you out of money, okay?

98
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.090
Now every project has a time budget and
a monetary budget.

99
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.370
And it's important to be aware of these
budgets, even if you don't directly

100
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.160
control them, because they will help you
to manage the data analysis process.

101
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.820
And importantly, you may need to
eventually argue for more resources or

102
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.560
more time, and you're going to have to
persuade other people in those cases.

103
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.762
So it's important to know when to stop the
data analysis process or the exploratory

104
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:49.963
data analysis process in order to prepare
results for presentation and to argue for

105
00:05:49.963 --> 00:05:53.824
continuation of the project, if that's
what you believe needs to be done.

106
00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:57.360
Keeping track of your time and
your budgets for both money and

107
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.310
time is an important part of managing
the data analysis process, so

108
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.984
that you kind of manage the continuation
into the next phase and

109
00:06:04.984 --> 00:06:07.644
to argue for
more resources if you need them.

110
00:06:07.644 --> 00:06:11.797
So these are some basic questions that you
can ask yourself to determine whether you

111
00:06:11.797 --> 00:06:15.040
need to stop the exploratory
data analysis process.

112
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.310
Are you out of data?

113
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.210
Do you have enough evidence
to make a decision?

114
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.360
Can you place your results
in a larger context or

115
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.160
do these results make sense, and
finally are you just simply out of time?

116
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.036
These questions will help you determine
how to manage the data analysis process in

117
00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:32.349
general and whether you can stop
the exploratory analysis process and

118
00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:33.601
move on to the next phase.
