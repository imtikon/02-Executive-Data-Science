00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.580
Inference is the task of making statements
about things you can't observe.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.871
This lecture's about the ingredients you
need to make useful inferences from data.

3
00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:15.523
So the goal of inference is to be able
to make statements about things we

4
00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:17.900
can't really observe directly.

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.467
And we also want to be able to
characterize our uncertainty about

6
00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:22.280
those statements that we make.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.170
So these things that we can't observe,
the things that we wanna make inferences

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.680
about, these are usually referred
to generally as the population.

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380
Okay, and then to make inference,

10
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.550
what we do is we collect
a sample from the population.

11
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.330
And the sampling process that we
use results in our dataset, okay.

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.220
So we have a dataset that results
from a sampling process that

13
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.940
draws from a population.

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.100
So to make inferences from data,
you need three simple ingredients.

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.020
First, you need to be able
to identify the population

16
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.620
to which you're making these inferences.

17
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.480
Of course you have to have a question
about that population, but

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.080
that's kind of secondary.

19
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.640
Once you've identified the population,

20
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.590
then you can talk coherently about
what you're making inference about.

21
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.320
The next thing you need to be able to
do is to describe the sampling process.

22
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.000
You need to be able to tell a story about
how the data came from the population and

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.795
ended up in your lap.

24
00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:14.900
Okay?
If you can't describe that process,

25
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.800
then it is going to be very
hard to understand how

26
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.290
valid your inferences are from the data.

27
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.540
The better and more clearly you can
describe how the data came to you,

28
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.520
the stronger your results will be.

29
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.110
Now the last thing you need is a model for
the population.

30
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.371
You need a model for how either elements
of the population interact with each other

31
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:34.942
or how they're related to each other.

32
00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:44.430
So defining the population is far and
away the most important task.

33
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.240
If you can't coherently
describe the population,

34
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.465
then you can't really make any inferences.

35
00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:51.575
Okay because there's nothing
to make inference to.

36
00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.285
So make sure that you can accurately
characterize your population.

37
00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:57.295
It's gonna help you tell the story better
in the end after you analyze the data.

38
00:01:57.295 --> 00:02:01.111
So similarly it's important that you
identify an important question that you

39
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:01.696
wanna ask.

40
00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.100
Just get an answer.

41
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.735
But presumably you've done this already.

42
00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:07.230
[COUGH] So just as a very quick,

43
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.150
simple running example,
here's a basic population of ten penguins.

44
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.990
Okay, and each of these penguins has
a turquoise hat or a purple hat.

45
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.490
And so
the basic question that we wanna ask is,

46
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.740
what proportion of this population of
penguins is wearing a turquoise hat?

47
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.080
So, that's basically it.

48
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.590
Now, the problem, of course,

49
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.340
is that we can't collect data
on the population, right?

50
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.834
Cuz they're penguins after all, and
we can't take care of all of them, so

51
00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:36.320
we need to draw a sample
from this population.

52
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.096
So the sampling process is the manner
in which the data come to you, and

53
00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.740
this gives you the dataset.

54
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.330
So, let's say we're going
to sample three penguins,

55
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.930
and the way that we sample those
three penguins is, we stand there in

56
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.530
front of these ten penguins and we take
the first three that walk up to us, okay?

57
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.930
So then we have our dataset
of just three penguins.

58
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.490
And so, now the model for the population
describes how the features of

59
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.200
the units in the population
are related to each other, okay?

60
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.060
And this model can be more or

61
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.510
less complex depending on the type of
question that we're trying to answer.

62
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.420
But the important thing is that the model
connects the data that we observe

63
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.210
to the population that we don't observe.

64
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.990
All right?

65
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.780
And so, it's basically a little
cartoon of how the world works.

66
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.030
So a couple of example of what a model
might consist of is that we might assume,

67
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.300
for example, that the units of the
population are independent of each other.

68
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.230
So imagine that the different
penguins in this population

69
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.650
are wearing different hats.

70
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.663
And the fact that one penguin is wearing
a turquoise hat doesn't really influence

71
00:03:35.663 --> 00:03:39.110
whether another penguin is gonna wear
a purple hat or a turquoise hat.

72
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.890
So they're all kind of
independent of each other.

73
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.440
That's one assumption that we'll
make as part of our model.

74
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.040
Another intentional assumption
that we might want to make is that

75
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.350
certain features of the population
are linearly related.

76
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.010
So there are linear
relationships between them.

77
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.760
And there are many other kinds of things
that you might wanna assume about

78
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.130
a population if your question's
a little bit more complex.

79
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.350
Now the question that we're
asking here is very simple.

80
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.090
We just wanna know what's the proportion
of penguins with turquoise hats.

81
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.020
So we don't have to make too many
assumptions about the population in order

82
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.440
to order that question.

83
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.709
So given our little data
set here of three penguins,

84
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.780
we want to estimate what's the proportion
with turquoise hats in the population.

85
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.505
So from the dataset we can estimate
that it's one-third of the dataset.

86
00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:22.930
One-third of the penguins
have turquoise hats so

87
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.960
we'll assume that one-third of
the population wears turquoise hats.

88
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.160
So that's what we're gonna
infer from our dataset.

89
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.430
Our final estimate is one-third or
.33 penguins with turquoise hats.

90
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.360
Now it turns out because we know
the population that the truth is about

91
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.050
point four penguins actually wear
turquoise hats, or two-fifths, okay?

92
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.500
So our estimate is 0.3 roughly and
the truth is point four.

93
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.550
And so the question is well how do we
know if 0.3 or 0.33 is a good estimate?

94
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.730
So we'll talk about that
in the next lecture.

95
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.746
In terms of how do you know whether
you've made a good inference or not.

96
00:04:54.746 --> 00:04:58.924
But the point is that our estimate
is .33 and the truth is .4.

97
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:00.990
So there's a variation
there as we would expect.

98
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.070
But that's our estimate for
the population level feature.
