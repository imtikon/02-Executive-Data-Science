00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:06.921
I'm gonna talk a little bit
more about populations and

2
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:10.617
the forms in which they can come because
populations can come in a variety of

3
00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:13.980
different forms that you
may not necessarily expect.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.800
Two common ones that I wanna talk about
are for data that vary over time or

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.560
data that vary over space.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.660
For example, suppose you
are looking at time series data.

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.400
You might be looking at the closing
value of Apple stock every day for year.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.145
You've got this data set, it's daily data
for a year of Apple's closing price.

9
00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:37.280
Suppose you wanna make
an inference from this data set,

10
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.670
what is the population there now that
you're trying to make an inference too?

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.990
There's a couple of different
candidates that you can think about.

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.980
The first is, this data came from
a single year's worth of data.

13
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.120
Apple's been around for many years.

14
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.740
You might think that this data
set represents a sample from

15
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.370
all the future or past years, for
example, of data that might exist.

16
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.360
This data's a random sample from all the
different years that you might look at.

17
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.850
Another possibility is that,
of course, Apple is on a stock market,

18
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.540
and there's other stocks that
trade on a stock market.

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.710
You might think of Apple
as being a random draw

20
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.290
from those other stocks
in the stock market.

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.300
For example, if you're trying to
approximate an index of stocks,

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.990
Apple would be a random
element of that index,

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.190
you might sample different
stocks to approximate the index.

24
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.820
The other kind of phenomenon that often,
where the population

25
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.700
can be difficult to define, is when
you're looking at natural phenomenons.

26
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.170
For things like earthquakes ,hurricanes,
or wildfires, things that occur in space,

27
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.940
you often collect data on that and
analyze it using models or whatnot.

28
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.890
But then if you want to make an inference,
you have to think a little bit carefully

29
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.290
about what exactly are you inferring,
or making an inference about?

30
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.520
Often with natural processes, it's useful
to think of an unobserved stochastic

31
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.230
process that lies in the background and
drops these events on the ground.

32
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.432
If you imagine there's a stochastic
process of earthquakes that randomly

33
00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:14.138
drops earthquakes into our world,
or wildfires, or hurricanes,

34
00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:19.830
whatever it may be, when you fit a model
and you make an inference from that model,

35
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.474
what you're inferring are properties
of this unobserved stochastic process.

36
00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:32.074
The last thing that I'll
talk about when it comes to

37
00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:34.934
inference is actually not
about inference at all,

38
00:02:34.934 --> 00:02:38.980
it's actually a special case of
using the data as a population.

39
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.850
The underlying question here really
that you want to ask yourself

40
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.190
is do you actually need to
make an inference at all?

41
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.780
Sometimes you can think of
the data set as a population.

42
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.564
There may be cases where you actually
have all the data you ever wanna see and

43
00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:56.340
then you actually don't care about
things that are outside the data set,

44
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.360
which is really, fundamentally,

45
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.580
what inference is about is that you're
talking about things outside the data set.

46
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.890
If the data are the population,

47
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.290
one of the features of your analysis
is that it will have no uncertainty

48
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.129
because there's no sampling process
that generates the uncertainty.

49
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.890
You won't have to worry about confidence
intervals or standard errors or

50
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.410
P values because you'll have all the
certainty in the world that you'll need,

51
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.620
assuming that you don't have any
problems with that data set.

52
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.580
There are many cases where, for example,
if you have data collecting on your

53
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.140
organization that you won't have to worry
about things that are outside the data set

54
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.599
because you may not be worried about
things that are outside your organization.

55
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.980
Try to always think
carefully about whether or

56
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.030
not you actually have to make an inference
because, in many cases, you may not.

57
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.690
Then you're analysis will
be greatly simplified

58
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.090
because you won't have to worry about
making statements about things that you

59
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.349
don't actually observe because
you actually observe everything.

60
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.240
Just to summarize, inference is
the process of making statements from data

61
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.180
about things that you can't observe.

62
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.190
There are many different kind of
populations that you can think about or

63
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.880
construct when you're
making inference from data.

64
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.530
Then there's the special case of
using the data as a population,

65
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.970
in which case you're not making
any inferences at all but

66
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.122
you actually have all
the information you need.

67
00:04:10.122 --> 00:04:14.322
It's useful to figure out what situation
you're in and for any given question, and

68
00:04:14.322 --> 00:04:16.749
to always define
the population coherently, so

69
00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.435
that you know what you're
making inferences about.
