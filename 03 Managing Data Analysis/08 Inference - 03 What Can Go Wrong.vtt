00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.368
There are a number of things that can
affect the quality of inferences that we

2
00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:04.033
make from data.

3
00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.832
This lecture talks about what
can go wrong with inference.

4
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:14.814
So the basic problems that occur
when we're making inference,

5
00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:18.292
usually result from a violation
of the assumptions that we make

6
00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:22.642
about the population, the sampling
process or the model for the population.

7
00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:25.015
So, I'm kinda talk about
each one of these things and

8
00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.565
kinda what happens when there
is some sort of violation.

9
00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:31.601
The first problem is that
the population is not well-defined.

10
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:33.358
So this is a big problem,

11
00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:38.065
because a vaguely defined population
leads to vague inferences.

12
00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:41.783
The sign that you have a vaguely defined
population is that often the results

13
00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:44.238
are uninterpretable or
difficult to interpret.

14
00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:47.849
And so this is really a problem that
isn't really solved by the data or

15
00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:48.920
affixing the data.

16
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.572
Really, it's about thinking a little bit
more clearly about what type of population

17
00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:54.460
you're trying to make an inference about.

18
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.637
Now the second problem you can have is
an incorrectly specified sampling process.

19
00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:04.244
Now what this results in is that
the sample data will not be representative

20
00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:05.517
of the population.

21
00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:07.699
Often, this is called a convenient sample.

22
00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:11.542
So when you collect data, you collect
data in the most convenient way and

23
00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:12.681
it may just involve.

24
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:16.439
For example, if you're studying
people in an observational study or

25
00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.708
in an experimental study, you just kinda
take whatever people come your way and

26
00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:22.124
enroll them in the study.

27
00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:26.491
This may not involve a sampling process
that represents your population.

28
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.556
It's often just a convenient sample.

29
00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:32.530
And so what the result of this is that
you'll have a what's called selection

30
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.816
bias, so the people in your study will
represent a selection of your population,

31
00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:38.887
but not really the entire population.

32
00:01:38.887 --> 00:01:41.254
And so
the result is that if you fit any models,

33
00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:45.567
if you estimate any characteristics from
your data, those things that you estimate

34
00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:49.781
won't actually apply to the target
population that you originally designated.

35
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:53.811
They will apply to some other population
that you may not be able to accurately

36
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:54.311
define.

37
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:58.715
So even if your model for the population
is correct and even if you have a sense of

38
00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:03.190
what your target population is if your
sampling process is not well specified or

39
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.664
well characterized or
if you don't understand it properly,

40
00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:10.670
then the data that you collect and
the inferences that you make will only

41
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.340
apply to some other population that you
haven't really well characterized yet.

42
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.205
So that's what can result from kind
of incorrectly specifying your

43
00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.369
sampling process.

44
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.260
The last part is incorrectly specifying
the model for your population.

45
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.751
Now recall that we said previously
that all models are wrong.

46
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:32.607
And for sure, you will incorrectly
specify the model for the population.

47
00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:36.897
And so really the goal is not to get the
correct model, but rather to get a model

48
00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:41.004
that's a reasonable approximation for
what the population looks like.

49
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:44.611
And so if you have the wrong model,
a couple of things may occur.

50
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.924
First, there may be
uncertainty in your estimates

51
00:02:47.924 --> 00:02:50.627
from the data that are not accounted for.

52
00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:54.826
So you may underestimate how certain you
are about certain characteristics of

53
00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:55.786
the population.

54
00:02:55.786 --> 00:03:00.330
Any parameters that you estimate from your
model may end up being uninterpretable.

55
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.102
And so if your model's incorrect,

56
00:03:02.102 --> 00:03:05.529
it doesn't correctly reflect
the relationships in your data in your

57
00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.607
population, then your parameters that you
estimate will not really apply to that

58
00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:11.995
population and
may be difficult to interpret.

59
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:14.319
Furthermore, in prediction
types of problems.

60
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.225
If you don't have the right model, then
it's pretty straightforward to see that

61
00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:21.520
your predictions just may be poor and
they may have a high error rate.

62
00:03:27.198 --> 00:03:31.304
So really what you need to know is kinda
what are the questions that you need to

63
00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:34.590
be asking when you're involved
in a data analysis process?

64
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.698
And so the three basic questions related
to the different kinds of violations that

65
00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:40.909
you might encounter when doing inference.

66
00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.819
So the first is can we
characterize the population?

67
00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.544
That's a very simple question and

68
00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:48.587
the solution is to really just
do more thinking beforehand.

69
00:03:48.587 --> 00:03:51.965
Before you engage in the inference
process, just take a little bit of extra

70
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.734
time to think about what the population is
and maybe engage in experts in this area.

71
00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:58.625
They may be inside or
outside of your organization.

72
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:04.585
The second question you wanna ask is
do we understand the sampling process?

73
00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:09.186
So what you wanna do about this is you can
either collect your own data in which case

74
00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:12.446
you can specify what the sampling
process is going to be.

75
00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:17.155
You can maybe collect auxiliary data
about the population characteristics.

76
00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:21.546
So if you have auxiliary data about
the population, maybe certain features of

77
00:04:21.546 --> 00:04:26.001
the population, then you can quantify
the differences between the sample that

78
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:30.676
you collect and the auxiliary data on the
population to see how different they are.

79
00:04:30.676 --> 00:04:37.001
For example, you might have data on
the sex of people in your study.

80
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:41.215
And so you might want to know, well if the
population is roughly 50, 50 male, female,

81
00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:45.102
but your dataset is say, 70, 30 male,
female, then you can characterize that

82
00:04:45.102 --> 00:04:49.089
difference between the data you collected
and the population your trying to target.

83
00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:54.595
Again, you can be more specific about
the differences between the two.

84
00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.706
So auxiliary data about
the population can be very useful for

85
00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:01.499
characterizing any sort of selection
bias you might have in your sample.

86
00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.516
The last question you want to ask is
do you have an appropriate model for

87
00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:05.293
the population?

88
00:05:05.293 --> 00:05:09.436
It's not going to be a perfect model, but
you hope it's a reasonable approximation.

89
00:05:09.436 --> 00:05:13.309
This can be kind of addressed to
a thorough exploratory data analysis or

90
00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:16.728
by using things, for example,
things like robust methods for

91
00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:19.717
inference when you're
fitting statistical models.

92
00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:22.775
Another approach is to
use very flexible models.

93
00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:26.192
Like machine learning methods
that are useful for making very

94
00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:30.999
accurate predictions without you having to
specify very carefully what the model is.

95
00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:35.023
Often, lots of machine learning types of
techniques can just learn the model from

96
00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:37.832
the data without you having
to be very specific about it.

97
00:05:37.832 --> 00:05:41.282
That can be very useful when you don't
have a good understanding about what

98
00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:43.262
the relationships of the population are.

99
00:05:48.323 --> 00:05:51.966
The final challenge to making good
inferences is sampling variability.

100
00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:54.063
Now I've left this to the end for
a reason,

101
00:05:54.063 --> 00:05:58.326
because sampling variability will exist
even if you've done everything else right.

102
00:05:58.326 --> 00:06:01.897
So you've defined the population,
you've described the sampling process,

103
00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:04.575
you've developed a reasonable model for
the population.

104
00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:07.024
By virtue of the fact that
you are sampling data,

105
00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:10.687
you will introduce uncertainty,
because you don't have all the data.

106
00:06:10.687 --> 00:06:14.412
And so every time you draw a sample,
it'll be slightly different and so

107
00:06:14.412 --> 00:06:18.884
anything you estimate about the population
will be slightly different every time you

108
00:06:18.884 --> 00:06:19.645
sample data.

109
00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:23.866
And so we'll talk a little bit more about
this in the lecture about interpreting

110
00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:25.120
data analysis.

111
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.610
But the important thing to know here
is that you should always be asking for

112
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.030
a measure of uncertainty along with any
estimate that's obtained from the data.

113
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.080
So any summary statistic or

114
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.760
any model parameter that you
can estimate from the data,

115
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.680
you should always be asking for a measure
of uncertainty that comes along with it,

116
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.410
because there always will be uncertainty
if you're sampling data from a population.

117
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.967
So just to summarize briefly, always think
about what the population's going to be.

118
00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:58.094
Always assess the sampling process and
think about differences between the data

119
00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:02.172
that you collect and the population that
you're trying to make inferences to.

120
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:05.695
Always try to diagnose your model
as carefully as possible or

121
00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:09.228
use a very flexible method to
kind of model your population.

122
00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:12.194
And lastly, always require
a measure of uncertainty for

123
00:07:12.194 --> 00:07:14.371
any estimate that you draw from the data.

124
00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:17.370
So these are the kinds of things that
can go wrong with inferences and

125
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.801
how you can try to protect
yourself from these things.
