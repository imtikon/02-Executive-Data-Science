00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.780
Formal modeling is the process
of precisely specifying

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.690
statistical models for your data, and

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.590
for providing a rigorous framework for
challenging and testing those models.

4
00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:17.905
So, at this point you've done a lot
of exploratory data analysis, and

5
00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:21.805
you probably have a reasonable sketch of
the solution that you're looking for for

6
00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:22.795
your question.

7
00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:26.865
But you may not be so sure about whether
that solution will hold up to kind

8
00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:32.140
of challenges or will be sensitive to the
little changes in the data or the model.

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.050
And so, formal modeling is the process
of kind of specifying your

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.100
model very precisely so that you know
what you're trying to estimate, and

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.330
you know how you can challenge your
findings in a rigorous framework.

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.070
And so, usually the way that
we write down these models

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.630
is with mathematical notation or
with computer codes so

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.600
that we can get very specific
about what we're trying to do.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.830
Using just words alone
to describe a model,

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.630
so that's why we usually have to resort
to mathematics or computer code.

17
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.390
Now, when we talk about formal models,
very often we'll talk about parameters,

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.500
and parameters play an important
role in statistical modelling.

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.140
Parameters usually represent
characteristics of the population.

20
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.890
They might describe relationships
between variables or certain features

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.620
like means or standard deviations, and
because they are characteristics of

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.790
the population they're generally
considered to be unknown.

23
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.420
So, we have to estimate
them from the data and

24
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.530
often the goal of an analysis Is to
estimate given types of parameters.

25
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.440
And the nice thing about formal
modeling is that it allows you to

26
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.000
specify which types of parameters you're
interested in and are trying to estimate.

27
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.930
So for example, in a linear regression,

28
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.130
the coefficients of the linear
regression models are parameters.

29
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.500
And very often your goal
is to estimate them.

30
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.750
So, the general framework for doing formal
modeling is very similar to kind of what

31
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.060
we've been talking about
all along in this course.

32
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.930
The three basic steps are setting
expectations, collecting information,

33
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.410
and then revising those
expectations based on what you see.

34
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.050
So for setting expectations, typically
you want to have a primary model,

35
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.020
which is your best sense of
what the solution should be and

36
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.010
what is the answer to your question.

37
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.740
This is the leading candidate based on
all the current information you have and

38
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.830
based on any kind of exploratory
analysis that you've done.

39
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.000
Now it's not necessarily going
to be the final model, it's

40
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.030
going to be the model that you start with
to kind of structure your formal analysis.

41
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.940
You may update it later based on
any information that you collect,

42
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.050
and you may change your primary
model to be something different.

43
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.550
So that's okay, and so you don't
have to worry too much about kind of

44
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.650
what your primary model is
going to be from the get-go.

45
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.600
Just pick one that seems reasonable
from the data, and provides a, kind of,

46
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.800
sensible solution.

47
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.760
And then you'll be testing it
in various different ways,

48
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.870
just to see if it's going to work.

49
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.730
So the next stage is
collecting information.

50
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.580
So given that you have a primary model,
you want to develop a series of what I

51
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.130
call secondary models to test and
challenge your solution.

52
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.780
So the basic idea of
a secondary model is that it's

53
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.780
slightly different from
your primary model.

54
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.320
It may add variables,
it may subtract variables and

55
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.600
you may add different functional forms.

56
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680
So it looks kind of like your primary
model but it has variations to it.

57
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.310
Those are all the secondary
models that you want to look at.

58
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.450
And the goal is to generate evidence
against your primary model.

59
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.560
Okay, so if you can generate evidence
that suggest that your primary model is

60
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.950
incorrect.

61
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.680
Then you can kinda update your thinking,

62
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.490
and try to come up with
a different primary model.

63
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.360
Another word for
this is sensitivity analysis.

64
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.690
So you wanna think about how
sensitive your primary model is to

65
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.850
various changes that are introduced
via the secondary models.

66
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.820
So we'll talk a little bit more
specifically about what this means

67
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.230
when we talk about our examples okay?

68
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.500
The last step of course is
revising your expectations.

69
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.220
And so if the secondary models are largely
consistent with your primary model and

70
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.650
exactly what consistent means depends
on the context and your application and

71
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.180
the question that you are asking.

72
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.940
And then that's great and you can
either move on to the next phase or

73
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.410
maybe you're finished and
you can just kind of record your results.

74
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.250
However, if your secondary models
successfully challenge your primary model

75
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.460
and maybe put some of your
initial conclusions in doubt,

76
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.560
then you may need to adjust or
modify the primary model to better reflect

77
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.440
all this additional evidence that you've
generated via all the secondary models.

78
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.716
And then you can start the process
again with a new primary model, and

79
00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:24.349
then perhaps a new set of secondary
models to challenge that primary model.

80
00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.064
And then you can iterate through this
process until you arrive at a model that

81
00:04:29.064 --> 00:04:31.938
you think reasonably
summarizes your data and

82
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.120
answers the question that
you were looking to ask.

83
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.850
So there's two basic types of situations
In which we often use formal modeling.

84
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.950
And I'm going to categorize them into
what I call Associational Analyses and

85
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.470
Prediction Analyses.

86
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.630
So Associational Analyses, there the aim

87
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.830
is to look at the association between
two or maybe more features while

88
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.080
in the presence of many other potentially
confounding factors, okay And so for

89
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.720
the most part we're interested in looking
at the association between two things, but

90
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.470
there may be other things that we have
to adjust for, or account for, and

91
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.150
that we want to make sure
we're accounting for properly.

92
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.790
So there's three classes of variables
in an associational type of analysis.

93
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.400
The first is the outcome.

94
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.160
The outcome is the factor or

95
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.700
the feature that we think varies along
with what I call a key predictor.

96
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.650
Now, it may not actually respond to
the key predictor in a causal sense,

97
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.350
but the idea is that when
the key predictor changes,

98
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.920
the outcome changes along with it,
whether it is causal or not.

99
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.680
So the next type class of variable
is what I call the key predictor.

100
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.780
And this is usually the predictor
of interest that we wanna know,

101
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.930
how does it vary?

102
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.260
How does the outcome vary
with the key predictor?

103
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.560
There may be one, or two, or

104
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.410
even three key predictors that
you're primarily interested in.

105
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.400
But usually the number will be small, and

106
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.790
very often the number
is actually just one.

107
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.910
And so the key predictor explains
some variation in the outcome and

108
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.020
it's something that you're interested in.

109
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.310
The last set is a very
large class of variables,

110
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.120
is all the potential confounders.

111
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.330
So these are things that tend to be, they
are associated with your key predictor and

112
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.550
they're also associated
with their outcome.

113
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.570
And they generally serve to kinda confuse
the association between your key predictor

114
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.480
and your outcome.

115
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.420
So these are things that often may need
to be accounted for in some way or

116
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.010
included in a formal model to properly

117
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.900
examine the relationship between
your key predictor and your outcome.

118
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.530
The next set of analyses that you
might do is a prediction analysis.

119
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.546
So a prediction analysis differs from
an associational type of analysis,

120
00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:44.690
because the goal here is to really to
use all available information to predict

121
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.790
an outcome, okay?

122
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.805
So you usually don't care
about the mechanism, or

123
00:06:48.805 --> 00:06:52.672
how things work when you're trying
to do a prediction analysis.

124
00:06:52.672 --> 00:06:56.607
So you don't necessarily care about
explaining how a variable can predict

125
00:06:56.607 --> 00:06:57.552
a given outcome.

126
00:06:57.552 --> 00:07:01.269
You just want to be able to generate
a good prediction from a set of variables

127
00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:05.165
and you're not developing some detailed
understanding of the relationships

128
00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:07.250
between all the features okay.

129
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.420
Now for most prediction analysis this
really isn't a distinction between

130
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.410
the key predictor and
a bunch of other potential confounders.

131
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.770
Usually all predictors
are considered equally cuz

132
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.400
they may contribute information
to predicting the outcome.

133
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.820
And before we do the analysis,
we may not weight them any differently,

134
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.370
we may weight them all equally.

135
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.630
Because we don't have any a priori
information about might more or

136
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.708
less important.

137
00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:33.680
Now any good prediction algorithm,
will help you to determine which variables

138
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.970
are useful for
predicting the outcome and which aren't.

139
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.309
And so they will help you sort that out.

140
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.410
Another feature of prediction analyses
is that, usually the model that you use

141
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.280
cannot be written down in
a convenient mathematical notation.

142
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.780
Often, the only way that the procedure can
be specified, is through computer code, or

143
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.090
through some algorithm.

144
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.850
And so,
often there's no parameters of interest.

145
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.070
So, you're not trying to
estimate any parameters.

146
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.830
You're just trying to make a prediction
using any combination of features,

147
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.220
using an functional form
of any type of model.

148
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.120
So that's kind of hallmark
of prediction analysis.

149
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.472
And finally, most prediction analysis
often are what you might call

150
00:08:12.472 --> 00:08:16.229
classification problems, so the outcome
is really something that takes two

151
00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:21.200
different values and you're trying to
predict one of those two different values.

152
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.880
So that's the kind of summary of
what formal modeling is used for and

153
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.360
in what context is may be used.

154
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.270
Whether it's associational or
prediction types of analyses.

155
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.304
In the next lectures I'll give examples of
associational and prediction analysis and

156
00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:37.897
how the formal modeling framework can
be used to work through these different

157
00:08:37.897 --> 00:08:38.853
kinds of analyses.
