00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.398
This lecture gives an example
of an associational analysis and

2
00:00:03.398 --> 00:00:06.030
how to use formal modeling
to challenge your findings.

3
00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.333
The basic form of a model in
an associational analysis will look

4
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.950
something like this.

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.460
You'll have an outcome, y and
you'll have a key predictor, x.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.110
And then you have maybe some potential
confounder that will call z.

7
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.920
And then you have some independent
random error that we call epsilon.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.570
In addition to those factors,

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.720
we have a number of parameters
that we wanna estimate.

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.890
So alpha here is the intercept.

11
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.600
It's the value of y when x and z are zero.

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.930
We have beta, which is the change in y
associated with a one unit increase in x,

13
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.620
adjusted for z.

14
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.180
And then gamma is the change in y
associated with a one-unit increase in z,

15
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.030
adjusting for x.

16
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.350
So, this is a linear model, and

17
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.160
the parameter that we're trying
to estimate here is beta.

18
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.200
That's what tells us how our outcome
changes along with our key predictor.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.550
Now, there are other parameters, gamma and
alpha, that are in the model and

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.590
we need to have them in the model for
the model to work.

21
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.750
But we're actually not
interested in those parameters.

22
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.760
So we sometimes call
them nuisance parameters,

23
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.220
because we have to estimate them, but
we don't actually care about their value.

24
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.530
So this is what I might
consider to be a primary model.

25
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.890
It's very simple, there's a key predictor
and there's only one confounder.

26
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.900
And so you may need to consider
other things later on, but

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.470
this is sometimes good as a primary model.

28
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.290
On the other hand,

29
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.170
sometimes we'll use a primary model
that doesn't have any confounders.

30
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.380
And then slowly add things to the mall
to see how our results change.

31
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.250
So the example I'm going to use here is
going to be an advertising campaign for

32
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.270
a new product.

33
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.640
Imagine you're selling something and
you're thinking you're buying ads on

34
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.770
Facebook and you wanna know how
effective those ads are gonna be.

35
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.140
So ultimately what you wanna
do is sell more products and

36
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.560
make more money from this.

37
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.060
And so one thing you might do is try to
pilot a one week experiment where you buy

38
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.875
Facebook ads for a week and
see how it does.

39
00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:59.965
So this is a very simple design,
you might say look at the one week before

40
00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:02.985
the ad campaign,
the one week during the ad campaign.

41
00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.705
And then the one week after
the ad campaign just to see

42
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:09.305
how the sales numbers change
while you're running the ads.

43
00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.985
Then you could compare the total sales for
the three weeks during,

44
00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:15.505
the three weeks before and
the three weeks after.

45
00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:18.630
And see if there is any reasonable
increase in the total sales.

46
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.470
So using this type of design and

47
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.780
this kind of experiment what
would you expect to see?

48
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.030
So here's a data set that's not real, but
it kind of represents the ideal scenario

49
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.150
for what you might see in
an experiment like this.

50
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.020
So in the first seven days you have
an average about 200 dollars per day.

51
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.670
Then the next 7 days,

52
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.030
this is during the campaign,
you have an average of about $300.

53
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.910
And then after the campaign finishes you
have an average of, again, about $200.

54
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.450
So it's possible to tell just from this
graph, without doing anything fancy,

55
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.710
that the ad campaign seems to add about
$100 per day to the total daily sales.

56
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.880
So, in this case,
your primary model might be very simple,

57
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.340
it might look something like this.

58
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.410
Where you have Y, is the outcome,
that would be the daily sales.

59
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.530
And then X is just an indicator of
whether a given day fell during

60
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.000
the ad campaign or not.

61
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.780
And then still your primary
interest is on the coefficient beta

62
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.100
which tells you how your total daily sales
increases with the ad campaign in place.

63
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.540
So for example, the data for

64
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.770
this might look something like this in
this table here where you have 21 days.

65
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.790
And you have seven days without the
campaign, seven days with the campaign,

66
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.310
and seven days without.

67
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.030
I can see that the daily sales change
as you go in and out of the campaign.

68
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.370
So it's a very basic setup,
very simple, and

69
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.080
this is kinda what you would love to
see in your data in an ideal world.

70
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.270
Of course, in reality,
you will never see data like this.

71
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.620
There will always be
something more complicated.

72
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.120
So here is a picture of
what kinda more realistic

73
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.780
data might look like from
an experiment like this.

74
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.390
Typically real world data are more noisy.

75
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.970
There are other trends in the background
that are kind of messing up your

76
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.500
relationship.

77
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.030
So it makes it harder to analyze the data.

78
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.970
So you'll notice that in this
picture there does appear

79
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.930
to be an increase in sales
during the campaign period.

80
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.160
But the problem is that it seems
like the increase started,

81
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.770
actually before the campaign even started,
the sales were kind of going up.

82
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.860
And so you might wanna ask,
well are there background trends that for

83
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.570
some reason increase sales
over a three week period?

84
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.390
So it's possible that we would've
seen higher sales in the product,

85
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.440
even without the ad campaign,
just because of these background trends.

86
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.350
And so
the question you really wanna know is,

87
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.270
did the ads cause an increase in sales.

88
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.580
Over and above whatever background trends
that might of been going on that you

89
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.380
that you're not aware of.

90
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.790
So let's take our primary model,

91
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.810
which is just gonna be a simple model with
the outcome and indicator of the campaign.

92
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.160
If we use that model, what you'll
see is that we'll estimate beta,

93
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.940
the increase in the daily sales due to
the ad campaign to be $44.75, okay?

94
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.600
Now, now let's suppose we add
a background trend into our model.

95
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.930
So instead of the primary model where
we just had the key predictor and

96
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.760
the outcome, we fit the following model.

97
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.432
Which has a quadratic trend for time, so
this allows for kinda a little curvature,

98
00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:05.986
and allows for kind of rising and
falling of the daily total sales.

99
00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:10.396
Okay, so if we use this model, and
we still try to estimate beta,

100
00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:14.690
what we get is that the,
our estimate of beta is $39.86.

101
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.100
So that's somewhat less than the beta
that we estimated for the primary model.

102
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.530
And recall that this is the increase
in sales due to the ad campaign.

103
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.260
So just for comparison, we can fit
actually even more complex model.

104
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.170
We could have a fourth order
polynomial to model the trend,

105
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.760
just in case there might be something more
complicated going on in the background.

106
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.530
And then if we were to fit that model,
this gives us a beta of $49.10 per day.

107
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.660
So under this model, the ad campaign added
an extra $49.10 per day to our sales.

108
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.890
So we have three models.

109
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.920
One primary model and
two secondary models.

110
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.483
And so, model one tells us that
our estimate of beta is $44.75.

111
00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:04.195
Model two tells us it's $39.86, and
model three tells us it's $49.10.

112
00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:06.080
So, what do we do with this?

113
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.870
So there are a number of ways to
evaluate your formal modeling and

114
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.410
your examination of primary and
secondary models.

115
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.690
The first thing you want to
look at is the effect size.

116
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.910
So the effect size essentially is what
is the value of beta that you estimate.

117
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.970
And is it big or is it small, or

118
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.250
how do they compare to each
other from the different models?

119
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.374
So the three different models represent
a range of going from roughly $39 to $49.

120
00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:35.330
And so you might wanna ask
yourself is that a big range?

121
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.250
Do you care about those differences?

122
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.070
It's a little hard to answer that
question without knowing kind

123
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.450
of what the context is and
what your situation is.

124
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.020
For example, if the cost of the ad
campaign were really low, and

125
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.460
it didn't really matter how much you
made as long as you made something.

126
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.690
Then maybe you don't care
whether it's $39 or $49.

127
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.730
As long as you make something back,
then the ad campaign's worth it.

128
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.400
On the other hand, if the ad
campaign were really expensive, so

129
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.180
maybe it's $20 a day to run these ads.

130
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.350
Then you might care which end of
the range you fall on when you

131
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.000
run this ad campaign, because maybe $39 is
not worth it, but $49 would be worth it.

132
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.410
So ultimately,

133
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.690
the question you're asking is is it
worth the risk of buying these ads.

134
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.220
Given the evidence that you've seen from
these different models showing you that

135
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.760
there might be a range of say,
$39 $49 increase in total sales

136
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.550
during the period of the ad campaign.

137
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.660
The second factor you wanna
think about is plausibility.

138
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.670
So even though we fit
many different models,

139
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.110
not all of them are equally plausible,
okay?

140
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.080
So the primary model may not be plausible,
because it didn't incorporate

141
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.010
the possibility of any sort
of background trend, okay?

142
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.260
And likely with real world data,

143
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.820
there's gonna be lots of things
going on in the background.

144
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.912
And you don't want to just forget about
them because they could affect how your

145
00:07:51.912 --> 00:07:55.326
sales go, and you may think your
campaign is having a big effect.

146
00:07:55.326 --> 00:07:57.953
When actually there's something just going
on in the background that's moving your

147
00:07:57.953 --> 00:07:59.090
sales numbers.

148
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.230
Now the third model that we did which
had this kind of fourth order polynomial

149
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.420
was a relatively complex
model to capture a trend.

150
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.280
And it may be too complex or

151
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.340
more than we need to capture a very
simple smooth trend in the background.

152
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.280
And so model two seems kind of reasonable.

153
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.430
We allow for this background trend.

154
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.290
It's a polynomial model.

155
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.060
But it's not very complicated, or

156
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.120
at least not overly complicated,
to try to capture this trend.

157
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.480
So whether a model could
be considered more or

158
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.880
less plausible will depend on
your knowledge of the subject.

159
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.480
And your ability to map real world events
to mathematical formulations of the model.

160
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.850
The last concept to think of is parsimony.

161
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.380
When different models tell the same story,
for example,

162
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.570
if you don't care about the range
of $39 to $49, then it's

163
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.850
sometimes better to choose the simpler
model or the model with fewer parameters.

164
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.510
And the reason is it's usually easier
to tell a story about the data

165
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.980
when you have fewer parameters and
so this makes the model more useful.

166
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.070
And then finally a simpler
model would be more efficient

167
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.480
because you're using more data to
estimate fewer parameters and so

168
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.670
that's generally good from
a statistical standpoint.

169
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.890
That will afford you to have
less uncertainty about those

170
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.319
parameter estimates because you're able to
use more data for each of the parameters.

171
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.700
So in this example,
this was an associational analysis, and

172
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.570
it focused on estimating
the association between two features.

173
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.980
Total sales and the ad campaign, while
adjusting for other confounding factors,

174
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.160
like this potential background trend.

175
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.350
The primary models kind of
capture the basic relationship.

176
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.910
While the secondary models
are used to kind of adjust for

177
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.470
different factors in different ways.

178
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.580
So we had two different models kind of
adjusting for the background trends.

179
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.430
So what conclusion you make ultimately
may depend on outside factors like cost,

180
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.440
or kind of timing issues.

181
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.560
And so you have to factor all this in
when you kind of ultimately draw your

182
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.910
conclusions about what to do or
what decisions to make.

183
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.870
And also, you may have to think about
the plausibility of the various

184
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.000
models that you've chosen.

185
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.420
To determine what evidence you're gonna
weight more heavily than other evidence.

186
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.510
So this is the basic kinda outline
of an associational analysis.

187
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.250
Obviously there'll often be many more
things that you're gonna wanna do.

188
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.480
But they'll generally follow this
framework, and you're gonna wanna iterate

189
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.730
between kinda fitting primary models and
secondary models.

190
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.714
And so you get to an answer that you
can use or can make a decision on.
