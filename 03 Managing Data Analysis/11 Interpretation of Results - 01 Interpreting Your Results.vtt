00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.310
This lecture is about
interpreting your results.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.690
Because data analysis is an iterative
process, interpretation is actually

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.560
something that happens continuously
throughout the whole process.

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.218
But because it's so important,
it deserves a separate discussion.

5
00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:21.249
Interpretation in the data analysis is
a continuous part of the entire data

6
00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.290
analysis process.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.450
And just like with other
aspects of data analysis,

8
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.980
everything you do is based on setting
expectations and kind of matching the data

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.010
that you collect with the information
that you collect to those expectations.

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.960
Now the expectations for your
interpretation will be based on things

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.220
like exploratory data analysis and
formal modelling.

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.132
Now when the interpretation does
not match your expectations,

13
00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:45.650
that you're gonna have to figure
out whether it's because your

14
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.200
expectations were incorrect or
because your interpretation is incorrect.

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.750
And so figuring that out is part of
the iterative nature of interpretation.

16
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.430
And even though this is one of
the last steps of any data analysis,

17
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.390
you may need to go back to
the exploratory data analysis or

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.550
the formal modeling stages if
the things that you've discover

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.790
in your interpretation challenge
what you found previously.

20
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.440
So there are a couple of basic principles
to keep in mind when interpreting results,

21
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.220
particularly in the later
stages of a data analysis.

22
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420
The first thing you're probably gonna
wanna do is to revisit your question,

23
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.940
and just to kinda make sure that you
haven't gone off course from your

24
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.530
original question.

25
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.160
The second thing you wanna think
about is your primary results.

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.640
So typically in a formal modelling,
you'll have a primary model and

27
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280
maybe some secondary models.

28
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.310
Particularly in an inferential or
causal type of question.

29
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.630
And so the primary result will be
kind of initially what you focus on.

30
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.490
It may not be the last thing
that you focus on, but

31
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.010
it'll be what you initially focus on.

32
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.110
And there are three things that you wanna
think about with your primary result.

33
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.690
That's the directionality,
the magnitude, and the uncertainty.

34
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.750
And we'll talk more
about this in a second.

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.390
But those are kind of the three properties
of any result that you're gonna

36
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.240
wanna think about.

37
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.920
Then there's the context.

38
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.130
The context is important because it
really takes into account the totality

39
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.585
of the evidence that you've developed
through both primary and secondary models.

40
00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:09.435
And when you look at the kind of totality
of the evidence, you wanna look separately

41
00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:13.895
at the direction, magnitude, uncertainty
of all the different models that you fit.

42
00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:18.315
And of course, you wanna join this
with everything that's already known

43
00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:21.305
about the question you're asking,
either from literature or

44
00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:22.769
from other colleagues
in your organization.

45
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.390
Last thing you wanna think about is
the implications, so you wanna consider

46
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.440
the implications of your analysis and how
they might determine what actions to take.

47
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.520
And it should be,

48
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.780
any actions that might be taken that are
a result of the answer to your question.

49
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.110
So that the implication is kind of
the last step of interpretation.

50
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.570
So revisiting the question is really
important because often in a long and

51
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.040
complicated data analysis, it's easy to go
off course or kinda go off on a tangent

52
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.140
while you're looking at
interesting things in your data.

53
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.020
This can happen either in
the exploratory data analysis process or

54
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.750
in the formal modeling phase.

55
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.640
And so

56
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.710
it's important to kinda either get back
onto track with your original question.

57
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.860
Or if you divert it onto a different or
perhaps more interesting question

58
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.170
to recognize that fact that you're
looking at something different.

59
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.820
So you may pursue other
important findings, that's okay,

60
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.160
but it's important to just realize
what question you're actually asking.

61
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.930
So because if your former modelling ends
up answering a different question and

62
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.110
perhaps the modeling approach doesn't
exactly match what the question was,

63
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.820
then you might have a problem
with interpretation later on.

64
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.100
So revisiting the question
is really important for

65
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.280
just setting your expectation for
what you will find in your results.

66
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.270
It's also useful to kind of
remind yourself of what type

67
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.140
of question you're trying to ask,
whether it was descriptive, exploratory,

68
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.890
inferential, predictive,
causal, or mechanistic.

69
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.960
Just to remind yourself of the kind
of nature of the question, and to

70
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.630
make sure that the analysis that you did
matched the question that you were asking.

71
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.339
So, most of what I'm gonna
talk about in this lecture

72
00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.409
really pertains to inferential or
kinda causal questions,

73
00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.070
where the interpretation
can be very challenging.

74
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.429
So, the other thing you wanna think about
as you reconsider your question is check

75
00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:12.400
for potential bias in your results.

76
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.047
So, given a certain type of question,

77
00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:19.160
you will have a population
that question applies to.

78
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.875
You'll have a sampling process that you
should be able to describe as part of your

79
00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.470
kind of data analysis process.

80
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.839
And it's useful to think about whether or
not that sampling process accurately

81
00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:33.076
represents the population or whether there
may be some bias in terms of who you

82
00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:36.420
selected into your dataset and
who exactly they represent.

83
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.030
So once you've got your primary model,
this is based on exploratory data analysis

84
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.910
and kind of formal modeling,
you're gonna have a primary result.

85
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.163
And the three things that you wanna
think about are the directionality

86
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:51.708
of the result, the magnitude,
and the uncertainty.

87
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:55.356
So directionality really pertains,
I think, to inferential and

88
00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:59.329
causal types of questions where you
try to estimate some association and

89
00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:02.800
the association can either be positive,
negative, or zero.

90
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.624
Now, so positive or

91
00:05:03.624 --> 00:05:06.680
negative is what we're talking about
when we talk about directionality.

92
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.450
And that's a very easy thing to check.

93
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.140
If you were expecting
a positive association,

94
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.310
then you can see whether
the result is positive.

95
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.170
And likewise,
if you were expecting something negative,

96
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.360
you can see whether
the result was negative.

97
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.820
So that quick check on directionality
is a useful kind of quick check for

98
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.430
seeing whether your results
kinda match your expectations.

99
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.630
The next thing, once you've solved
the directionality issue is the magnitude.

100
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.310
So the magnitude is really
the size of the association or

101
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.090
the size of the effect that you estimate.

102
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.330
And the question you wanna ask is
does that magnitude make sense?

103
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.390
Is it meaningful to you?

104
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.930
And what would be the impact
on the population

105
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.070
of having an effect of this size or
if the association was of this size?

106
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.790
So who would be affected is
an important question when

107
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.790
you kind of think about the magnitude and
whether it's meaningful to you or not.

108
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.080
The last thing of course,
you wanna think about is the uncertainty.

109
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.537
At this phase it's important that
you focus on continuous measures of

110
00:06:02.537 --> 00:06:03.358
uncertainty and

111
00:06:03.358 --> 00:06:07.296
not kind of binary measures of yes,
no's or statistical significance or not.

112
00:06:07.296 --> 00:06:09.333
Things like confidence intervals and

113
00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:13.213
other measures that can give you a sense
of the range of possibilities and

114
00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:17.538
kinda be magnitude of the uncertainty in
your estimate are useful at this phase,

115
00:06:17.538 --> 00:06:21.657
before you start making decisions
about what to do or what not to do.

116
00:06:21.657 --> 00:06:24.287
So the directionality,
magnitude, and uncertainty,

117
00:06:24.287 --> 00:06:27.337
are the key things to look at when
you've got your primary model results.

118
00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:31.587
Now in addition to primary model results,
you'll have a lot of secondary

119
00:06:31.587 --> 00:06:34.427
model sensitivity analyses,
other things that you tried.

120
00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:37.817
And this will kinda make up the totality
of the evidence for your analysis.

121
00:06:37.817 --> 00:06:40.227
And so you're gonna wanna think
about each of these primary and

122
00:06:40.227 --> 00:06:45.210
secondary models, in the context of the
three's factors that we just talked about,

123
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.580
which are directionality,
magnitude, and uncertainty,

124
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.090
kind of roughly in that order.

125
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.770
So, when you look across all of
the evidence that you generated,

126
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.680
how is the directionality preserved,
or not.

127
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.960
How is the magnitude of the effect or
the association preserved, or not.

128
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.960
And how is the uncertainty about
your estimate preserved or not?

129
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.120
How does those change from model to model?

130
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.170
If the directionality changes then that
may call into question whether you've

131
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.500
got a reasonable modeling strategy or

132
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.350
if even that association actually
exists in the population.

133
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.210
If the magnitude changes
that may indicate you've got

134
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.670
a potential confounding going on, or
maybe you've got to think about what

135
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.880
type of model is the best model for
estimating this type of association.

136
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.060
And similarly, if the uncertainty
blows up when you add certain

137
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.970
factors into your model, then that will
indicate to you that maybe you don't have

138
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.730
a very good estimate of an association or
an effect in the population.

139
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.630
And finally of course, included with the
totality of the evidence, is the kind of

140
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.670
any results they may already be existing
that people have researched before.

141
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.120
People, either in the literature or
in your organization,

142
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.410
that people already know about.

143
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.420
And you wanna know how your results,
along with kind of

144
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.470
the evidence that you've generated, are
consistent or not with existing results.

145
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.250
Finally, it's important to think about
the implications of your analysis.

146
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.320
So many analyses are done to
ultimately inform a decision.

147
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.620
And so any kind of positive findings that
you find that match your expectations may

148
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.780
require some follow up before
it ultimately decision is made.

149
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.550
So sometimes with inferential questions
where you're just looking for

150
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.660
an association, if the association is of
interest that meant you evolved into kind

151
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.660
of asking a more causal question where
you may need to design a different

152
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.630
kind of study, maybe an intervention,
or a controlled trial.

153
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.300
So that may be the decision that
results from your analysis.

154
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.420
But the ultimate decision and
how much evidence is needed to

155
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.160
inform that decision will
depend on the stakeholders of

156
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.010
the analysis of who asked for
the analysis, who is being informed by it,

157
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.450
and kind of what their cost benefits and
what their kind of values are.

158
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.080
And so, different groups of people
will interpret evidence differently,

159
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.870
not because of their
interpreting it incorrectly but

160
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.100
rather their decision to act on evidence
will based on a variety of factors that

161
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.405
are really outside the dataset and
are not really part of the analysis.

162
00:09:09.405 --> 00:09:13.785
So it's important to always keep in
mind the ultimate goal of the analysis,

163
00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:18.375
the decision that might need to be made,
and the stakeholders who are involved in

164
00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:21.455
making those decisions and what kinds
of factors they need to consider.

165
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.780
So, just to summarize,

166
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.120
when it comes to interpreting results,
you wanna always revisit the question,

167
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.515
make sure you know what question you're
asking and what type of question it is, so

168
00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:33.630
that you can figure out whether
the analysis matched the question.

169
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.230
Think about your primary result,
and for that result,

170
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.710
you wanna consider the direction,
the magnitude, and the uncertainty.

171
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.360
There's gonna be many
results that you generate, so

172
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.940
you wanna think about
the totality of the evidence.

173
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.920
So this is the context
that we're talking about.

174
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.180
And for each of the kind of results that
you generate, you similarly wanna think

175
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.940
about the direction, magnitude,
and uncertainty of those results.

176
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.740
And you wanna combine this evidence that
you've generated with existing knowledge.

177
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.510
Finally, the implications of analysis
are always important to consider.

178
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.229
And you wanna think about how the evidence
that you generate will inform the next

179
00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.910
steps, or any decisions that
might be made afterwards.
