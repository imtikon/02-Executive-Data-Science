00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.530
There are two kinds of communications
that you want to engage in

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.500
while you're working
through a data analysis.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.368
This lecture talks about the more routine
kinds of communications that you do on

4
00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:10.300
a day to day basis.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.560
Communication is fundamental
to good data analysis.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.180
That's because data analysis
is a highly verbal process and

7
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.580
requires regular back and forth and
discussion to move the process forward.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.090
In this kind of setting, both informal and
formal communications are very important

9
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.895
and you want to be able to coordinate
communication between members or

10
00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:39.025
with yourself to make sure that
the process is constantly moving forward.

11
00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:41.725
In this lecture, I will talk more about
the kind of routine communications and

12
00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:44.595
the purposes of those routine
communications as the data

13
00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.275
analysis project moves forward.

14
00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:52.770
Routine communication is an important tool
for performing any good data analysis and

15
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.380
it's important to realize that
communication is both a tool and

16
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.890
a product of data analysis.

17
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.675
Ultimately, when you've completed
a data analysis project,

18
00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:03.605
you're gonna wanna communicate your
findings and your results to an audience.

19
00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:08.010
That's communication as a product but
as you go through the whole process,

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.860
you want there to be constant
communication and dialog so

21
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.640
that you can assess findings and
challenge them constantly

22
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.170
to make sure that you get
the best results that you can.

23
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.630
Any good data analyst
is gonna be engaged in

24
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.900
regular informal communication multiple
times through the data analysis process.

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.670
They're also gonna keep in mind the way
in which the ultimate results can be

26
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.810
communicated to a wider audience and think
about what's the best way to do that.

27
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.840
It's important to ensure that
the people in the data science team or

28
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.030
the analysts stay on task with these
two basic communication goals.

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.192
The basic purpose of a routine
communication is to gather information,

30
00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:54.855
you gathered communication by
communicating your results and

31
00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:58.870
by taking in the responses
from your audience.

32
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.390
Hopefully, that will inform the next
steps of your data analysis.

33
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.310
The form that a routine communication
takes depends on the goal or

34
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.842
what kind of information
needs to be collected.

35
00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:14.926
For example, you might need an answer to
a very focused and technical question,

36
00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:20.550
it's often just a clarification or about
the details of a data set or a model.

37
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.720
Ultimately, you want to
gather a single fact.

38
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.950
At the next level, you might want to
get some feedback about results that

39
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.100
are puzzling or unexpected as you
were analyzing your data set.

40
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.680
In the last level, you may not have
any specific question whatsoever but

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.210
you want to gather information
about the overall process and

42
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.410
get some first impressions and
feedback about what you're doing, so

43
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.350
you can refine your data
analysis even further.

44
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.360
It's important to kind of classify
the purpose of a given communication and

45
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.340
to provide the appropriate environment and
audience for that communication.

46
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.960
Just a few quick examples.

47
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.100
For example, when you're at a narrow
level, you might want to say

48
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.040
clarify the coding of a variable
because maybe the metadata's unclear.

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.220
Maybe if a variable is labeled zero or

50
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.690
one, you may not know what it means
by zero and what is meant by one.

51
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.030
There may be a specific person that you
can talk to to answer that question and

52
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.010
the communication will be very brief and
to the point and

53
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.120
the answer will just be a single fact,
essentially.

54
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.610
At the next level, you might be
doing exploratory data analysis and

55
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.590
you are looking at the data and you see
something that's really unexpected,

56
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.050
remember it's part of the EDA process.

57
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.610
You always set your expectations for
what the data should look like and

58
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.910
then when you look at the data or
you make a plot or a table and

59
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.050
it doesn't look like what you expected,
and you can't quite explain,

60
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.730
it you may need to communicate
that to a person or

61
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.400
a group of people in order to get
some feedback or answers about that.

62
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.840
This might take the form or

63
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.890
an informal meeting with a few people
to present some preliminary tables or

64
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.890
figures, you may need to show
the data in terms of visualizations.

65
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.550
At the highest level,
you may have reached a major milestone, or

66
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.830
maybe you've developed a primary model,
and

67
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.389
you want to get some feedback
on what you've done so far.

68
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.800
Part of this is just this idea that you
always wanna be checking to see that you

69
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.100
haven't missed anything, you wanna be
challenging your results all the time.

70
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.630
This may require a slightly larger
audience, maybe a team meeting or

71
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.100
a group meeting,
where you present your results and

72
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.630
get some feedback on what you've done so
far.

73
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.320
There are a couple of just core
concepts that are important for

74
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.200
any type of routine communication
that you wanna think about.

75
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.670
The first, of course, is the audience.

76
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.350
To the extent that you might be able to
control the audience that you present to,

77
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.740
you wanna make sure that you have
the right people or the right person, so

78
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.730
that you can get the most efficient
answers to your question.

79
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.678
It's important to know your audience and

80
00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:56.860
make sure you've got the right people
in the room to get the right feedback.

81
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.040
The next thing to think
about is the content.

82
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.530
It's important to be prepared,
so that you can be focused and

83
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.360
concise about what you're trying to say or
what you're trying to communicate.

84
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.160
But also it's important to
provide sufficient information so

85
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.199
that the audience can understand where
you're coming from and where you're going.

86
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.360
Especially, if you have
an interdisciplinary type of audience,

87
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.220
you wanna make sure that everyone's on
the same page at the very beginning.

88
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.350
As far as the style is concerned, I
generally find it useful to avoid a lot of

89
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.520
jargon because as soon as the audience
grows to more than just a few people, it's

90
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.060
likely that different people will have
different expertise, and different skills.

91
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.090
You're not gonna want to use
very technical jargon that will

92
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.450
only be understood by a small
subset of people, try to

93
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.965
use language that'll be understandable
to a broader range of people.

94
00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:51.620
Try to design your figures and
tables so that people with a broad

95
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.360
background will be able to understand
what's going on in those figures and

96
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.289
tables with just a little
bit of explanation.

97
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.070
Finally, it's just your attitude
when it comes to communication,

98
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.480
and it's important to have an open and
collaborative attitude so the audience

99
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.830
is fully engaged in giving you feedback
and helping you out with your analysis.

100
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.960
The point is not really to think about
yourself as defending the analysis but

101
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.690
rather to work to get their input so
you can do your best work.

102
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.700
This is a basic sketch of
kind of routine communication

103
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.840
as you're going through
the data analysis process.

104
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.590
This may be something that you
do without much thinking but

105
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.225
actually, it's a very important
part of the data analysis process.

106
00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:35.812
It's important that the communication
works between team members,

107
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:40.786
between managers and team members and
that it's a continuous process to get

108
00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:44.220
feedback and
improve the quality of data analysis.
