00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.174
This lecture provides just a couple of
ideas of how to make a good data analysis

2
00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:04.963
presentation.

3
00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:13.141
There are a couple of key components that
I feel like are important to making a good

4
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:15.450
presentation that involves data analysis,

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.940
and so I thought I would just
list a couple of them here.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.000
Just so
you can kind of keep them in mind and

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.710
think about them the next time you're
making your next presentation.

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.530
So, the first and I think the most
important thing you want to have in

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.020
a presentation is to state the question
that you're trying to answer.

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.910
I can't tell you how many times
I've been in a presentation and

11
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.490
we've been ten minutes in and

12
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.005
I still don't exactly know what question
this person is trying to answer.

13
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:40.770
Okay.

14
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.140
So, it's important, upfront, that you not
assume that everyone is on the same page,

15
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.820
that everyone has the same background,
but to state the question clearly and

16
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.432
succinctly so
that everyone knows what the goal is.

17
00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:53.980
Okay.
And once everyone knows what the goal is,

18
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.690
we could all be kind of on the same page
and oriented towards achieving that goal.

19
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.320
Okay.
So stating the question

20
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.210
is very important from
the get go in a presentation.

21
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.740
Secondary to that, you might want to
describe what type of question it is that

22
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.740
you're trying to answer if it's
not immediately obvious, okay.

23
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.630
So remember that we have the six types
of questions that you can try to ask.

24
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.260
And so it's useful to the audience
sometimes to know if you're trying to

25
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.940
ask an inferential question versus
a causal one, versus a predictive one.

26
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.430
That can help to inform any discussion
that may occur afterward in terms of

27
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.440
improving your analysis or modifying it.

28
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.685
Another thing that I like to do that I
think is very useful is to show the data.

29
00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:33.770
Okay.
It's often helpful or

30
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.810
tempting to just show summaries, or you
just kind of just not even data summaries,

31
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.820
but just kind of summaries in
words of what the results are.

32
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.620
But it's actually very
useful to show the data.

33
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.780
But just as a warning though,
this could be a double edged sword.

34
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.850
Because people like to talk
about data when they see it.

35
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.510
So if you want people to have good
discussion, to have informed discussion

36
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.640
that may be useful to you,
I think it's very useful to show the data.

37
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.930
People love to talk about data, but, so
even if you don't want that discussion to

38
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.240
happen necessarily, you may be better
off in the end if it does happen.

39
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.650
And so to this extent,
I find plots are better than tables,

40
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.530
because plots show people, you know,
a summary of the data, but

41
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.060
they also show people deviations
from what might be expected, and so

42
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.230
plots are very useful for
kind of producing discussion and

43
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.010
kind of encouraging people
to think about the data.

44
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.390
When it's possible, if you're making a
presentation and you're showing the data,

45
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.530
if you're showing some summary or
a statistic about the data,

46
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.940
try to show a measure of
uncertainty to go with it.

47
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.239
And the reason why is it just provides for
a richer discussion when you can

48
00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.415
incorporate the uncertainty
into any predictions or

49
00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:45.973
any estimates that you make from the data.

50
00:02:45.973 --> 00:02:49.483
And so, try to have a broad array
of measures of uncertainty so

51
00:02:49.483 --> 00:02:53.680
that people can get the full picture
of what's going on in your analysis.

52
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.390
So for example, if you have a primary
model, it can be used to show results for

53
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.860
say, a bunch of secondary models or to
show confidence intervals for parameters.

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.380
Lastly, I think it's important that when
you present results from a data analysis,

55
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.260
that you separate three things,

56
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.080
they are the evidence,
the interpretation and the decision.

57
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.790
Okay?

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.460
It's often easy to kind of conflate
all these things into one sentence or

59
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.960
to one statement and
I think it helps people to

60
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.780
provide a useful discussion
if you can separate them out.

61
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.850
So for example, if you're looking at,
let's say, an air pollutant and

62
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.570
some health outcome, you might find that

63
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.390
the increase in the air pollutant results,
you estimate that

64
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.950
an increase in the air pollutant results
in a 5% increase in the health outcome.

65
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.780
So that's bad.

66
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.170
So maybe the health outcome is mortality.

67
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.030
So, an increase in the pollutant results
in a five percent increase in mortality.

68
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.510
So that's the evidence,
that is the result of your analysis.

69
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.420
You estimated some parameter and
that was the result, and

70
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.660
maybe there's a competence level that
you can present around that too.

71
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.740
So, the interpretation might be,
okay air pollution is bad for you, okay,

72
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.450
and then the decision might be we
need to lower air pollution levels in

73
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.740
whatever environment we're thinking about.

74
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.399
So there's three separate components there
that all could be evaluated independently.

75
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.450
Given a set of evidence,
you're interpretation might be that,

76
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.460
oh if it's only 5% maybe air
pollution's not so bad for you.

77
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.320
Or it might be 5% and it's terrible.

78
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.950
But your interpretation can be
made separate from the evidence

79
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.900
that's provided.

80
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.640
And further more, what you do about it is
further separate from what you think about

81
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.702
it, how you interpret it,
and what the evidence is.

82
00:04:31.702 --> 00:04:34.558
So, separating the evidence,
the interpretation, and

83
00:04:34.558 --> 00:04:38.220
the decision can help people think
about the different components.

84
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.300
And can weigh the evidence, in terms
of how they would react differently or

85
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.430
how important that evidence is to
whatever process they're involved in.

86
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.374
So, I think doing that provides for
a useful presentation and provides for

87
00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:54.379
a more important, a useful discussion
about the meaning of your results and

88
00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.958
what we should do about them.
