00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.980
Have you ever had the perfect
data science experiment?

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.740
You ran an AB test.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.830
Data collection pulls and
mergers all went perfectly.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.560
There was no missing data.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.670
The sample was easily generalizable to
the population you're interested in.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.174
Tests were robust and highly significant.

7
00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:21.794
And actual conclusions were obvious
from the results of your test.

8
00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:23.651
Has this ever happened to you?

9
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:24.483
>> No.

10
00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:25.968
Of course not.

11
00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:30.868
Instead, your experiments are with
observational data on a sample that isn't

12
00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:34.455
representative of the population
that you're interested in.

13
00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:37.450
You have missing data and
errors in data collection.

14
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.060
Through a complex merging.

15
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.720
The results of your test are borderline
and the conclusions are not clear.

16
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.550
Welcome to data science in real life.

17
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.030
This class is about the ying and

18
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.600
yang of when data analysis is ideal,
versus when it's hard.

19
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.489
We'll cover the common pitfalls and
protections from them in data analysis.

20
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.120
We'll talk about how design can
protect you in your recourse for

21
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.420
when design is out of your control.

22
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.260
We'll discuss when it's appropriate
to throw in the towel and

23
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.660
say that your data just can't answer
the questions that you'd like to ask.

24
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.210
So welcome to the class,
I hope you enjoy it.

25
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.810
And let's begin.
