00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500
This is the lecture on the perfect data
science experience versus real life.

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.030
Let's start by talking about
the perfect data science experiment.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.960
Here we've got the happy little cat
looking at a highly significant p value.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.950
So in the perfect data science experiment,

6
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.410
you have clearly defined hypotheses
that are specified a priori.

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.360
And experimental design
is available to you.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.840
For example, you can use randomization
across the treatment of interest.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.080
You can stratify or
block on some nuisance variables.

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.990
Your sample is a random sample
from a population of interests so

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.350
you know that it's generalizable.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.680
And the data that you have are directly
able to interrogate the hypothesis that

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.480
you're interested in.

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.764
All the data set creation and merging and

15
00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:50.750
data pulls from the larger
data set goes smoothly.

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.940
There's no missing data or dropout, and

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.480
your analyses are robust without the need
for any sort of advance modeling.

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.023
Your conclusions are clear and

19
00:01:00.023 --> 00:01:02.939
parsimonious of knowledge is
gained via the experiment.

20
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.980
And the decision is obvious
being given the data and

21
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.742
communicated clearly with a nice report or
out going data product.

22
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.760
What happens in real life?

23
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.895
Well, in real life, Often

24
00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:26.800
the data is needed to both inform the
hypotheses and interrogate the hypotheses.

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.190
Often multiple comparisons are an issue
because you've tried several different

26
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.860
hypotheses or
you're looking at multiple things at once.

27
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.310
Often your access to experimental
design is limited or nonexistent.

28
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.570
The data is often
completely observational.

29
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.410
So the population being studied isn't
the population that you're interested in.

30
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.310
That's often a problem,

31
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.220
your sample isn't representative of
the sample you'd like to generalize to.

32
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.550
The data don't have the exact measurements
that you need to evaluate the hypothesis.

33
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.020
This is a surprisingly common problem.

34
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.200
You'd like to study caloric intake, but

35
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.160
all you have is
questionnaires asking people

36
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.040
how many calories they ate last week,
which they can't usually remember well.

37
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.040
The data set is problematic, merging
is problematic with multiple matches or

38
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.870
no matches.

39
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.094
Data entry errors,

40
00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:20.558
the data pool doesn't go the way that
you want, so often the case that just

41
00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:25.400
the reality of building the analytic
data set is a challenging process.

42
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.740
You have missing data and because of the
observational nature of your experiment,

43
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.270
advanced modelling winds
up being required.

44
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.780
And then because you need advanced
modeling, advanced computing is needed to

45
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.470
fit the model, which raises
issues with robustness and bugs.

46
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.330
Then, you're all done with this process,
and

47
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.350
the conclusions wind up
being indeterminate.

48
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.380
And the decision is not substantially and

49
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.750
further informed by the data and
the models that you've fit.

50
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.960
So, that's what happens maybe,
maybe in some of the worst case scenarios,

51
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.650
but that's more like what happened
tends to happen in real life.

52
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.670
So in this class we're gonna contrast data
science in the ideal versus data science

53
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.470
in real life.

54
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.260
We're gonna talk about
different variations

55
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.640
of experimental design versus
observational studies.

56
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.560
We'll talk about how you can, some ideas
for how you can check for errant data and

57
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.300
other tools to make data analysis in
real life a little bit more manageable.

58
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.010
So the class is set up

59
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.220
as this introductory set of
lectures plus then six lessons.

60
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.380
Each lesson has a quiz, each quiz has five
questions, you need to pass four out of

61
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.630
the five questions to get credit for
the quiz and you can do retakes.

62
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.390
Before each lesson, or at the beginning
of each lesson is a reading and I would

63
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.270
suggest you do the reading before you go
on to do a lot of the other materials.

64
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.570
So I'm gonna finish this lecture in a
second by giving you some examples of data

65
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.460
science in the ideal versus data science
in real life that I've concocted but

66
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.810
welcome to the class.

67
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.210
I'm really glad that you're in it and
I look forward to working with you for

68
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.020
the next couple of days as we talk
about data science in real life.
