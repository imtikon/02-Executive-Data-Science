1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.940
So let's go through some examples of
ways in which things can go right and

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.690
things can go wrong.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.200
So my colleagues wrote
this wonderful paper

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.080
exactly about the issue of using your
data to come up with your hypotheses.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.480
They work in the area
of Multiple Sclerosis.

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.770
And a common problem in the area of
Multiple Sclerosis brain research with

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.450
magnetic resonance imaging which is what
they work on is actually defining what it

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.500
means for a lesion which is one
of the hallmarks of the disease,

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.760
a brain lesion to be so-called enhancing,
so

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.300
it's sort of getting a greater
amount of blood in the area.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.240
So, they put forward
a framework necessarily because

12
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.890
the hypotheses weren't clear, they put
forward a framework that both identified

13
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.340
the hypotheses and interrogated
the hypotheses with the same data set.

14
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.060
And of course they're
statistical researchers so

15
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.470
their emphasis was on doing
this in a rigorous fashion.

16
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.530
But it's just an example
of a setting where

17
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.460
the hypotheses just couldn't immediately
be come up with in a clear fashion and

18
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.405
so the data had to perform double duty of
both coming up with the hypotheses and

19
00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:17.763
interrogating those hypotheses.

20
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020
Multiple comparisons.

21
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.850
Since we're on the subject of brain
imaging, which is the area that I work on,

22
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.760
multiple comparisons is often an issue,
and in one particularly famous example,

23
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.870
some people put a dead
salmon in an fMRI machine,

24
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.550
which is there to detect brain activation.

25
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.188
And of course there's no brain
activation in a dead salmon.

26
00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:45.490
And what they found is that if you do
lots and lots and lots of tests, and

27
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.950
you don't account for that correctly, you
can see brain activation in a dead salmon.

28
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.960
A very famous example of randomization
that occurred kind of recently,

29
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.480
at least in the past decade,
was from the Women's Health Initiative.

30
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.270
The Women's Health Initiative conducted
a study, a randomized trial of

31
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.338
hormone replacement therapy, which at the
time was a fairly standard treatment for

32
00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:18.296
post-menopausal women.

33
00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:25.260
The results of these randomized trials
contradicted what was thought of as common

34
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.880
knowledge for the efficacy of hormone
replacement therapy and the safety of it.

35
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.670
And so it brought about a lot
soul-searching about the value

36
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.920
of randomized trial versus the value
of a lot of observational data.

37
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.340
And I think it's maybe not necessary
to go into the weeds of this study

38
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.770
for the purposes of this lecture.

39
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.560
However, suffice it to say, the randomized
trial carried a lot of weight with it

40
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.730
because of the randomization.

41
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.920
All the previous observational trials
where they just saw whether or

42
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.380
not women were on hormone replacement
therapy and watched them over time.

43
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.080
The multitude of those studies was

44
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.180
not deemed as rigorous as the one
study that had randomization,

45
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.000
where women were actually randomized
to hormone replacement therapy or not.

46
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.480
And as a side note, if you're
interested about reading up on hormone

47
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.850
replacement therapy, I put a website
here from the Women's Health Initiative

48
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.320
where you can actually go and
look on the frequently

49
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.340
asked questions relating to some of
the studies that have done since then.

50
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.750
There's been a decade of
work since then to further

51
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.820
refine the science on
this particular issue.

52
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.740
The main point for
this lecture is how important

53
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.380
randomization was In
this particular setting.

54
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.390
So here's an example of a study
that I was involved in,

55
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.030
where you can't actually
measure what you'd like to.

56
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.190
So in two ways in this study,
you can't measure what you'd like to.

57
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.970
So my colleague,

58
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.418
Susan Bassett, was interested
in studying Alzheimer's disease.

59
00:04:05.418 --> 00:04:08.470
And what she'd really like to know is,

60
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.860
well before people have Alzheimer's
disease, what do their brains look like

61
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.070
with regard to these functional
magnetic resonance imaging scans?

62
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.000
So well before it, and that would be very
useful, because if you could see that

63
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.170
there were some changes in the brain
well before people developed symptoms,

64
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.060
maybe you could treat it.

65
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.880
So this is a big deal actually
in Alzheimer's research,

66
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.720
is trying to find precursors for
the disease.

67
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.290
So there's two problems that
occur with respect to measurement

68
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.880
in this particular study.

69
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.470
First of all, the fMRI machine doesn't
actually measure brain activation.

70
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.340
It measures a proxy for brain
activation through blood oxygenation.

71
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.790
So it actually, we can't actually
measure in living humans to the spatial

72
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.560
extent that we'd like, the brain
activation in the way that we'd like.

73
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.980
So there's one sense that the technology
just can't measure exactly what we'd like,

74
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.610
it only measures a proxy.

75
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.104
But, let's put that to the side and

76
00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:04.670
then talk about another way in which
we're not measuring what we like.

77
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.690
We can't know in advance who's
going to get Alzheimer's disease,

78
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.440
we can only guess.

79
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.320
And so in this case what she
looked at was people who

80
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.100
were at very high familial risks.

81
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.300
They had affected siblings, or affected
parents, multiple affected siblings and

82
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.620
affected parents and
then in the other group they had

83
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.880
people with no affected siblings and
affected parents.

84
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.000
But that doesn't mean that everyone
in the familial risk group

85
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.540
is gonna contract Alzheimer's disease.

86
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.840
Quite the opposite,
relatively small fraction of them has.

87
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.670
And that doesn't mean no one in the other
group is going to contract Alzheimer's

88
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.380
disease, and some of them did, eventually.

89
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.370
This was a long study, over 15 years.

90
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.550
So later on they saw some results for
people who actually converted.

91
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.400
But the point being here that she can't
actually measure what she needs to.

92
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.220
She can't prospectively measure
who's going to contract this disease

93
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.230
in the future.

94
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.710
Because if you did, the problem
wouldn't be worth studying, right?

95
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.110
That's everything that you'd like to do.

96
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.770
So the measurement is a very
clear problem in this case and

97
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.600
what you have to combat this
with is giant sample sizes.

98
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.420
You just having a greater percentage
of likely people that are gonna get

99
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.390
Alzheimer's disease in the one group and
a smaller percentage in the other group.

100
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.320
And you need a much larger
sample size to account for

101
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.730
the fact that you're going to see
much smaller effects from the fewer

102
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.990
people of eventual disease
type in the one group and

103
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.320
the fewer people of control
type in the other group.

104
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.940
So, again, this just serves as an example
where the measurement that you'd

105
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.410
like to have,
isn't the measurement that you get.

106
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.800
And this is very common in
data science experiments and

107
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.830
you need to work around it.

108
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.760
Just like Susan in this case did by
conducting one of the largest fMRI

109
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.000
experiments that anyone had seen at
the time, just to combat this issue.

110
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.780
So in this class we're gonna dig through
various facets of the perfect data science

111
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.410
experience versus real life.

112
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.500
And we'll use this idea of what's
ideal versus what tends to happen

113
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.030
as our launching point for
all of our discussions.

114
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.330
And we'll give some practical
recommendations for

115
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.930
the messy situations and
how you can manage

116
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.820
the people doing the data analysis if
it's not you and you're the manager.

117
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.720
How you can manage and help direct
them to different solutions for

118
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.550
this collection of various problems
that arise in data analysis.

119
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.628
So welcome to the class, and
we look forward to seeing you in it.
