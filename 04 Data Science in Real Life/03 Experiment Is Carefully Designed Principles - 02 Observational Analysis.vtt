00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.740
Hi.
My name is Brian Caffo and

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.573
this is a lecture on experimental
design and observational analysis.

3
00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:12.730
I'm gonna begin this lecture
with a quote from R.A.

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.140
Fischer, one of the forefathers
of modern statistics and

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.630
probably the greatest thinker
ever about experimental design.

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.160
And he said to call in the statistician
after the experiment is done,

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.860
may be no more, than asking him to
perform a post-mortem examination,

8
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.210
He may be able to say what
the experiment died of.

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.308
So, in this lecture we're gonna talk
about the difference between experimental

10
00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.547
design and observational studies.

11
00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:45.465
And so, let me go a little bit
deeper into what these two subjects

12
00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:48.110
are really talking about.

13
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.700
Experimental design is the case
where you have tight control

14
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.550
over several aspects of the experiment.

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.000
So, good experimental design
can do things like account for

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.070
known important factors through things
like blocking and stratification.

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.340
In addition, it can account for
unknown factors through randomization.

18
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.280
We'll have an entire
lecture on randomization.

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.420
Experimental design in terms of getting
a good sample via random sampling,

20
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.440
can help us get an unbiased sample for

21
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.690
extrapolating to the population that
we're interested in extrapolating to.

22
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.750
If you execute good
experimental design and

23
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.090
everything goes well, often it eliminates
the need for complex analyses.

24
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.160
Simple analysis usually suffice and
are better in these settings.

25
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.810
And they help us isolate
the effects of interest.

26
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800
In contrast,
in an observational experiment,

27
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.460
this is the opposite setting where
you don't have tight control

28
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.940
over the experiment and you can't
have good control over the sample.

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.770
You can't randomly assign treatments,
and these sorts of things.

30
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.330
In a purely observational experiment,
you're just observing the data,

31
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.060
collecting it as it occurs, and
this has some benefits as well.

32
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.450
For example, it's often feasible
when designed experiments are not.

33
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.310
You can't, for

34
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.400
example, ethically randomize
people in a smoking trial, right?

35
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.640
You can't randomize some people to
have to smoke and other people to not.

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.350
As a consequence of just getting
the data as it roles in,

37
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.120
often both by necessity and
just by happenstance.

38
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.650
Observational studies often
have very large sample sizes.

39
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.380
They're usually a lot
cheaper to execute as well.

40
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.660
The process of designing an experiment,
and

41
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.710
if you're collecting data on,
for example, medical trials,

42
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.600
clinical studies are extremely expensive,
thousands of dollars per subject.

43
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.070
Often observational studies can
get much larger sample sizes and

44
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.870
thus by having a much lower
dollar cost per record.

45
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.640
However on the negative side, in order
to get things out of observational data

46
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.210
analysis, you often need
much more complex modeling.

47
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.260
Because you haven't been able
to do things, like control for

48
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.470
known important factors
as part of the design.

49
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.880
You haven't been able to inject
randomization into your analysis

50
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.890
to help control for the unknown factors.

51
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.819
So, you have to try and figure out and
measure everything possible.

52
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.410
So, it's often the case,
it's almost always the case that

53
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.960
an observational study needs these larger
sample sizes to accommodate the much

54
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.080
more complex analysis that
you have to do to study them.

55
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.790
And by the way,

56
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.280
this picture here on this slide
Statistical Methods, Experimental Design,

57
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.440
and Scientific Inference by R.A.
Fisher is sort of a classic in this area.

58
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.860
Fisher was one of the forefathers of the
thinking on modern experimental design.

59
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.830
So, all I want to do is
really set the stage for

60
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.510
the next couple of lectures, where we're
going to cover several key topics of

61
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.955
experimental design versus
observational analysis.

62
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.940
As an example, we're going to
talk about sampling and bias.

63
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.550
And we'll give the specific example
of when the Chicago Tribune

64
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.070
announced errantry, that Dewey defeated
Truman in the Presidential election.

65
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.020
And much of their error was in this
particular form of bias sampling.

66
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.310
The collection of people that they polled,
weren't the right collection of people

67
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.730
to make the conclusions that
they were interested in.

68
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.000
We'll talk about randomization and
a, b testing, so

69
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.820
randomization is the process
when you have a treatment or

70
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.610
something that you're interested in
studying that say has two levels of

71
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.259
randomly assigning the observational
units to those two levels.

72
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.040
And so, the classic example of this is in
a medical trial, where you have a drug or

73
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.650
something like that and you give
a random set of people the drug and

74
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.080
you give another random
set of people the placebo.

75
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.320
And the idea is that the group of people
that receive the drug and the group of

76
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.390
people that receive the placebo, other
than receiving the drug or the placebo.

77
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.790
Are otherwise similar, so you're comparing
apples to apples or oranges to oranges,

78
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.610
if you will.

79
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.430
Because the randomization
has helped ensure that

80
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.590
everything else that might contaminate our
results was at least equally distributed

81
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.950
among the groups with high probability.

82
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.090
So, we'll have a lecture
on randomization and

83
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.140
this forms the basis of
so-called clinical trials and

84
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:38.130
AB testing which are bedrock methods
in data science and biostatistics.

85
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.810
Confounding is another core topic that
occurs In observational data analysis.

86
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.210
When you don't have randomization and

87
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.505
you need to think about variables
that can contaminate your results.

88
00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:56.908
You have to think about confounding,
and here Jeff came up with this funny

89
00:05:56.908 --> 00:06:00.887
example of the number of people who
drowned by falling into a pool,

90
00:06:00.887 --> 00:06:04.724
how it correlated with films that
Nicolas Cage appeared in, and

91
00:06:04.724 --> 00:06:09.480
finally, we're gonna talk about
causal inference and counterfactuals.

92
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.600
So, causal inference is the idea of trying
to use observational or experimental

93
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.080
data to get a true statistical cause,
rather than just association.

94
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.130
And we're going to only consider one
particular way of thinking about

95
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.400
causal inference, and
that's the idea of a counterfactual.

96
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.500
Where you consider two states
of existence, one where

97
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.910
a person has received the treatment for
example, and one where a person has not.

98
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.820
And in this case,
the same person is in both these pictures.

99
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.530
This is Christian Bale in both pictures.

100
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.520
So, counterfactuals or
the idea of thinking

101
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.270
along the lines of what
would happen to each of

102
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.120
my observational units if they didn't get
the treatment that they actually received?

103
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.160
So, of course,
you don't actually get to observe this.

104
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.590
If you give a person a drug,

105
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.060
you only get to observe them
after they've had the drug.

106
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.290
You don't get to observe
what would've happened,

107
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.360
had they not received the drug, okay?

108
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.630
But counterfactual thinking forms
the basis of causal thinking, so

109
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.280
we'll have a lecture on that.

110
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:23.510
That way of thinking will help us a, and
I hope after that lecture you'll see this,

111
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.490
will help us a, improve the way that
we come up with statistical designs.

112
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.504
To analyze data.

113
00:07:31.504 --> 00:07:34.550
It's because we'll be thinking casually.

114
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.000
And b, it'll help us think about
observational data analysis in a way

115
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.610
that will help us question our
assumptions, so that we can

116
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.170
think about if we're gonna try to make
the leap from associations to causation.

117
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.630
What sort of assumptions
are we making to do it?

118
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.910
So, hopefully you'll get
a lot out of that lecture.

119
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.930
The final thing I talk about is blocking,
and

120
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.860
in blocking this comes from the idea
of agricultural experiments,

121
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.070
where you have a field where there
might be some sort of gradient.

122
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.150
For example, the water is distributed
differently along rows of the crops.

123
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.810
Or the soil is distributed differently and

124
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.620
crops tend to be conveniently
actually sectioned into rows anyway.

125
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.710
I have a picture of one here.

126
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.759
So, Ari Fischer worked in agricultural
experiments, so we actually talk about

127
00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:28.879
blocking, we tend to think in terms of
these sorts of agricultural experiments.

128
00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:34.162
So, the idea, if you know that something
like the soil or the water along rows

129
00:08:34.162 --> 00:08:41.140
of your crops, may impact the outcome that
you'd like to study, like your crop yield.

130
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.240
Then if you're gonna do
something like randomization,

131
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.610
why not do it within the rows, okay?

132
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.520
So, make sure you condition on the row.

133
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.240
Okay?

134
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.910
And randomize within the rows.

135
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.430
So, and this is the process of blocking.

136
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.620
Another example that
occurs often in genomics,

137
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.450
is let's suppose you're studying mice.

138
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.840
And the mice have litters, okay.

139
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.070
So, every collection of
parents of a litter,

140
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.180
they might have five or
six mice in a litter.

141
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:13.760
Okay?

142
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.330
But there's genetic inheritance
that occurs from the litter, so

143
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.550
if you're studying something, why not
randomize it within litters of mice,

144
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.390
rather than to all the little mice
regardless of what parents they had?

145
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.210
The reason for blocking on parents.

146
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.180
Right?
Is to control whatever genetic factors

147
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.490
are associated with the parents.

148
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.000
So, that's another example,

149
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.980
blocking is another example of
experimental design that we'll cover.

150
00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:45.940
S,o hopefully this has given you a bird's
eye view of some potential techniques that

151
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:51.350
you can use, to think about observational
data analysis, and experimental design.

152
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.380
And hopefully after this lecture,
you know that there is a dichotomy

153
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.610
between instances where you
have the idealized setting,

154
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.250
where you have complete control over
the whole experimental process,

155
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.140
versus the other end of the spectrum where
you have no control and you have purely

156
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.180
observational data, and of course
there's lots of gray areas in between.

157
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.000
But hopefully this will get you thinking
about the strengths and weaknesses and

158
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.770
potentials and
pitfalls of each of the different sorts.

159
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.990
In the next couple of lectures we're
gonna go over some of the details.
