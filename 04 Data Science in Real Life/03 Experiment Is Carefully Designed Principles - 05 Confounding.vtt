00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:04.820
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo.

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.830
And this is the lecture on confounding as
part of our executive data science series.

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.780
I'd like to thank Jeff Leek who wrote
these slides, and I'm giving the lecture.

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.700
So sometimes you see
unexpected patterns in data.

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.970
And as an example, we have here the number
of people who've drowned by falling into

6
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.340
a pool, by the films Nicholas Cage
has appeared in over time.

7
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.500
And there's a strong correlation
just by happenstance.

8
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.690
So what are some of the reasons that
we see spurious correlations in data?

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.390
Probably this example isn't the best,

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.600
because this isn't really
an example of confounding.

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.380
And we'll go over why in a few slides.

12
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.450
But one potential reason we
see associations that maybe

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.350
don't make sense or are not real is
because of the idea of confounding.

14
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.650
And confounding is one of
the central topics in statistics.

15
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.310
And I would say it's one
of the core reasons that

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.740
observational data analysis is hard.

17
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.900
Let's go through a simple exam
that Jeff concocted just to

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960
illustrate the principle of confounding.

19
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.520
Here we see a picture of Jeff
playing with his son Dexter.

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.610
He points out that he has big shoes,
and he's literate,

21
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.770
he claims he's somewhat literate, but
I've seen him read and he's literate.

22
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.300
And Dexter has little tiny shoes and
is not literate because he's a little kid.

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.620
So, imagine conducting a data analysis

24
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.080
with some variables, and
you see an association like that.

25
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.090
Well, in this example you might say,

26
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.910
okay, well,
is shoe size associated with literacy?

27
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.950
But there's another variable,
which is age.

28
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.700
In this case, Dexter is young and
Jeff is older, middle aged he claims.

29
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.380
And so that is ultimately the intermediary
between the relationship.

30
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.610
So we might put it in a graph like this
where we have shoe size, literacy and

31
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.720
age, and we have the arrows in the sense
that age corresponds to shoe size.

32
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.450
Younger people have smaller feet.

33
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.540
Older people have bigger feet.

34
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.200
And age corresponds to literacy.

35
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.300
As we age and develop,
we develop our reading skills.

36
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.100
And so this is the idea of confounding.

37
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.650
That the confounder exists between
what you're using to predict, and

38
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.550
what you are predicting.

39
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.830
And it, the name confounder,
comes because it can confound.

40
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.430
In other words,

41
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.430
it confounds the relationship
that you're trying to look at.

42
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.670
So, here's another funny example that he
came up with that came from the XKCD comic

43
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.790
book, where sales correlate with
geography, but so do lots of other things.

44
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.760
And this is basically what
this comic is illustrating,

45
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.590
is that whenever you look
at any of these heat maps.

46
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.980
Right?

47
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.950
What you see are very consistent hotspots,
and

48
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.530
those hotspots tend to just be where most
people live, and the comics says, pet

49
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.770
peeve #208, geographic profile maps which
are specifically just population maps.

50
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.590
In other words,
whatever you're trying to study and

51
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.259
geography is being confounded by the
number of people that live in that area.

52
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.610
So confounding just to reiterate and
to summarize this lecture, confounding

53
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.620
is the idea that a relationship between
a variable you're interested in and

54
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.540
an outcome is spurious and

55
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.150
really due to a third variable that
really is associated with the other two.

56
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.900
Okay?

57
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.090
And so It's very often the case that we
find relationships in our data set and

58
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.560
have to be able to navigate
through things like confounding

59
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.110
to figure out whether these associations
are real, or whether they're fake.

60
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.450
And just to give you a sense to
foreshadow some later lectures,

61
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.140
how do we deal with confounding?

62
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.660
How do we address it?

63
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.340
Well the big way that we address it
is through things like adjustment.

64
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.850
In the first case with the shoe size
example if we had a bunch of people and

65
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.710
we had their shoe sizes and we had a bunch
of people and we had their reading levels.

66
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.440
If we fit a model that had shoe size
we'd get a positive association but

67
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.900
if we adjust it for age right?

68
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.210
If we adjusted for age,
then that association would go away.

69
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.330
Same thing here where if we looked at
geography as it was associated with

70
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.400
whatever they were looking at, subscribers
to Martha Stewart Living in this case.

71
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.300
And we accounted for
population density at that

72
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.410
geographic location,
then the relationship would go away, okay?

73
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.166
So, adjustment,
things like adjustment using models,

74
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:03.700
is going to be one of the ways that
we look to, to address confounding.
