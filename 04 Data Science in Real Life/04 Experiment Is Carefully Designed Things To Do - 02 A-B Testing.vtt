00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.534
Hi.
My name's Brian Caffo, and welcome to

2
00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:08.201
the lecture on A/B testing as part of our
Executive Day science specialization.

3
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:13.490
I'm going to start this lecture by
posing one of the most fundamental

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.200
questions of our time, and
that is how can Jeff sell more books.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.860
So Jeff is another one of
the instructors in our specialization,

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.190
and he does have a book called
the The Elements of Data Analytic Style.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.250
It's a great book.

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.980
Get it off of Leanpub.

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.840
So imagine if Jeff had two Twitter's
ad campaigns he'd like to compare

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.830
to see which one was more effective.

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.530
The first one says, a practical but
non-technical guide to data analysis.

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.650
Pay what you want.

13
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.200
And the other one says,
a book of non-technical tips for

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.700
analyzing data the right way.

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.620
[INAUDIBLE] So, he wants to
compare these two ad campaigns,

16
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.230
what are some possible strategies
he might use to do that?

17
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.440
Well, one is he could run the ad serially.

18
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.600
He could run for a couple of weeks
the first ad then run the second one for

19
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
a couple of weeks.

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.820
Maybe after a washout period, and

21
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.310
then compare the conversion rate during
the time periods of the two ads.

22
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.170
Now, that has the problem
that anything that he found,

23
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.020
whether it's an effective ad type or
absence of effect, could also be

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
attributed to whatever's aliased with
the time periods that he was studying.

25
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.230
For example, imagine the first ad ran
during Christmas or a major holiday.

26
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.870
Then, of course people's purchasing
patterns are different during that time of

27
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.950
year, than during a time where
there isn't a major holiday.

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.240
So, he wouldn't be able to conclude
that there is a difference or absence of

29
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.490
a difference because of ad campaign
because of this lurking variable and

30
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.830
that's what we're going to study today.

31
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.160
I think this idea of lurking variables and

32
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.680
confounding underlies a lot of the issues
with observational studies and

33
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.140
why in particular in nutritional studies
we see kind of opposite results so often.

34
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.110
Chocolate is good for us one week and
it's bad for us another week.

35
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.700
And I saw this great article
where it's a blogger,

36
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.660
of E Magazine, written by healthcare
journalists for healthcare journalists.

37
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.680
And the title was, Don't fudge
the facts on chocolate studies and

38
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.770
it actually goes through many of
the topics we're gonna talk about today.

39
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.170
So such as confounding, but chocolate is
one of these examples where frequently

40
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.600
it's associated with cancer,
it's not associated with cancer, etc.

41
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.390
So I'd like to use chocolate today to
discuss the issue of confounding and

42
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.560
how randomization as is used in A/B
testing and randomized controlled trials,

43
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.310
how that can help combat
some of these issues.

44
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.490
And I made up a little data set and
it's a little bit contrived.

45
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.130
But, kind of purposefully so, so
that you can just focus on the concepts.

46
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.410
In this case, we have two group,
to the left the group of people who

47
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.400
eats chocolate and to the right the group
of people who don't eat chocolate.

48
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.760
We're interested in
ascertaining whether or

49
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.950
not chocolate lowers our blood pressure,
for whatever the reason.

50
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.930
So everyone who has a smiley
face has low blood pressure,

51
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.170
and everyone who has a frowny
face has high blood pressure.

52
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.110
And if you were to look at this data set
where we just observed people's chocolate

53
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.290
eating patterns and compared the two
groups, you'd see five out of either for

54
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.310
the chocolate group and three out of
either for the non-chocolate group

55
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.619
had low blood pressure or
had normal blood pressure.

56
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.200
And so you might conclude that if there
was enough subjects of this sort, maybe

57
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.850
let each smiley face represents 1,000
people or something like that, then you

58
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.190
would conclude that there's a significant
difference associated with chocolate.

59
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.760
However, imagine if there
was a lurking variable.

60
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.990
In this case, imagine that
the lurking variable is whether or

61
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.210
not the subject is taking
anti-hypertensive medication.

62
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.340
Something that's clearly
related to blood pressure.

63
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.050
In this case the group of people who are
naturally eating chocolate happen to have

64
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.600
a much higher percentage of people who are
taking this anti-hypertensive medications.

65
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.824
And if you count 5 out of 7 for the red
faces, the people on the medication,

66
00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:22.257
3 out of 9 for the blue faces
being happy,there's a greater

67
00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:25.029
percentage of people with
lower blood pressure,

68
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:29.204
on the anti hypertensive medications,
likely due to their medications.

69
00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:33.190
So in this case, you can't really
ascertain whether this effect is due to

70
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.373
the chocolate or due to the
anti-hypertensive medications, we haven't,

71
00:04:37.373 --> 00:04:42.250
you know, for this made up example,
I think we'd all probably conclude it's.

72
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.620
Likely do to the anti-hypertensive
medications.

73
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.330
So, how can we combat that?

74
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.190
Ideally, we'd like to compare two groups

75
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.780
with an equal mixture of people
who are on medication versus not.

76
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.670
Or we could fix medication and
compare just among

77
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.630
those taking medication,
their chocolate-eating habits and

78
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.530
just among those not taking medication,
their chocolate eating habits.

79
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.600
Of course that later
strategy requires us to know

80
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.100
what variables we need to control for
and to have measured them.

81
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.010
Randomization, on the other hand,
is an attempt to balance the observed and

82
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.760
unobserved variables that
may contaminate our result.

83
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.460
In randomization,
we simply randomize every subject.

84
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.720
In this case, you've randomized them and
say go eat a bunch of chocolate, and

85
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.420
randomize the other group and
say you're not allowed to eat chocolate.

86
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.800
The fundamental problem, of course, with
randomization in many cases like this one,

87
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.760
you can't ethically carry out a random,

88
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.990
ethically or
practically carry out a randomized trial.

89
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.870
So the goal of randomization again
is to compare like with like.

90
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.710
Get apples to apples and
oranges to oranges,

91
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.960
in other words the group's that
you're comparing have an equal, have

92
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.840
roughly equal proportional mixtures of all
the lurking variables that are associated,

93
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.160
that are typically associated with
the predictor and with the outcome.

94
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.110
And you've broken that
association with the,

95
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.020
with the treatment by virtue
of the randomization.

96
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.100
And I'll give you this wonderful quote
that I think summarizes this idea

97
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.130
very neatly.

98
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.820
It's by R.A. Fisher, one of the early
pioneers on the subject of randomization.

99
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.440
And he said randomization
properly carried out,

100
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.670
relieves the experimenter from
the anxiety of considering and estimating

101
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.770
the magnitude of the innumerable causes
by which his data may be disturbed.

102
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.650
This by, this quote,

103
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.550
by the way, I found in a wonderful paper
by Armitage on Fisher, Bradford Hill, and

104
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.650
randomization, a discussion of some of
the early thinking on randomization.

105
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.410
Let's return to our example, and

106
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.760
see what would likely have
occurred if we had randomization.

107
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.590
Well it would make, at least with
high probability, the treated and

108
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.570
untreated groups having
roughly equal proportions

109
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.530
of people on anti-hypertensive
medications and people not.

110
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.940
And in this case,
we got the opposite result.

111
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.970
3 out of 8 for chocolate and
5 out of 8 for no chocolate.

112
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.470
So, as an example.

113
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.800
Now the effect actually reverses itself
when we perform the randomization.

114
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.440
I'd like to close this lecture by asking
the question is randomization a cure all?

115
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.740
Is it all we need to think about for

116
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.940
trying to solve some of the problems
with observational studies?

117
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.410
And the answer of course by
posing this question is no.

118
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:37.280
And one particular way in which bias
can creep back into randomized studies

119
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.660
is through missing data and I concocted
an example where in this case for

120
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.130
the chocolate group its just like before 3
out of 8 its the same set of smiley faces

121
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.840
and frowning faces as before, but for the
non-chocolate group almost every person

122
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.350
who was not taking anti-hypertensive
medications dropped out of the study.

123
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:02.190
They said for whatever the reason
there most of them were frowny faces.

124
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.840
So they were saying I've
got high blood pressure.

125
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.250
I feel like eating some chocolate.

126
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.270
Whatever, they dropped out of the study.

127
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.700
And so
now the comparison is contaminated again

128
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.980
by the fact that the groups
aren't directly comparable.

129
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.380
The mixture of anti-hypertensive
medication folks

130
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.920
is different in the two groups.

131
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.900
So just as a fun, and

132
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.960
again the specifics of all the different
ways in which A/B tests or

133
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.820
a randomized trial can fail is perhaps out
of the out of the purview of this class.

134
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.710
But I just want to emphasize the fact
that just because you've randomized

135
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.810
the necessary things to think
about don't just end there.

136
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.790
So at any rate I'd like to
summarize this lecture.

137
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:54.240
And the fundamental point of this lecture
is the main characteristic of A/B testing,

138
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.170
which is the main characteristic of
randomized trials in the medical

139
00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:03.760
literature, is the idea of using
randomization to balance these confounding

140
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.000
factors in lurking variables that would
otherwise contaminate the results.

141
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.480
And the benefit is that they hopefully,
at least with high probability,

142
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.350
will balance both the known confounding
factors and the unknown ones as well.

143
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.200
So I hope you enjoyed today's lecture and

144
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.000
I look forward to seeing
you in the next class.
