00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.980
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo and

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.050
this is the lecture on Bias as part of our
executive data science specialization.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.900
I want to distinguish the kind of bias
that I'm talking about today with

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.690
some of the other things that we've
talked about before, like randomization.

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.420
The goal of randomization is to
make the two groups that we're

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.040
studying as comparable as possible.

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.550
So if we randomize a treatment and
a control to a collection of subjects,

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.380
then they're otherwise
similar other than whether or

9
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.830
not they receive the treatment or
control, with high probability at least.

10
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.590
That doesn't mean necessarily
that the collection of

11
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.160
patients that you're
studying are representative

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.180
of the broader collection of patients
that you'd like to draw conclusions on.

13
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.840
For example, patients in clinic
trials often are very good at

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.060
adhering to their medications where as
the general population may be less so.

15
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.270
This, of course, carries over to
discussion of thinks like AB-Testing.

16
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.440
So why is this relevant?

17
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.760
Well it's relevant because
statistical inference,

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.550
kind of the fundamental
component of statistics,

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.810
is the process of making conclusions
about a population from our sample.

20
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.480
It's not enough to just say
things about our sample.

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.340
We actually want to generalize that
knowledge beyond our sample and

22
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.020
that is the process of
statistical inference.

23
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.990
Well, if our sample isn't representative
of the population that we'd like to draw

24
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.670
inferences on, then we have a problem.

25
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.530
And things can happen like this.

26
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.820
When the Chicago Tribune declared
that Dewey defeated Truman,

27
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.439
when in fact Truman won the election.

28
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.160
The root cause in this case was a kind
of bizarre sampling scheme that

29
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.450
led to an erroneous conclusion.

30
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.870
Another famous example is
the so-called Kinsey Report.

31
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.440
In the Kinsey Report, the collection of
study subjects involved a lot of people

32
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.240
with psychological disorders and
prisoners.

33
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.380
And then the main criticism of the work
was that it wasn't generalizable

34
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.900
beyond this somewhat different
population that it was studying.

35
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.030
It's interesting to note that Kinsey's
response was to collect more subjects, but

36
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.206
again, not representative subjects.

37
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.520
And this of course doesn't
solve the problem.

38
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.819
Simply getting a greater end of a biased
sample doesn't correct the bias.

39
00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.730
In fact, in a sense, it makes it worse.

40
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.934
So what can you do?

41
00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:29.430
And that's what we're
gonna talk about today.

42
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.550
Different strategies for handling bias.

43
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.830
Well, I could think of three.

44
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.970
So, how do we combat sampling and
other forms of bias?

45
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.140
Well, one of the best ones is random
sampling, here's a picture of an urn.

46
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.920
Urn problems are sort of famous
in statistics for sampling.

47
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.370
So, random sampling is exactly that,

48
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.590
we try to draw subjects randomly from
the population that we're interested in.

49
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.850
This can often be quite hard to do.

50
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.710
For example, in polling, there's an entire
science devoted to getting accurate polls

51
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.110
and getting your sample random so
that they don't have inherent biases and

52
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.609
they don't make
a Chicago Tribune style mistake.

53
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.830
One, for example,

54
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.380
one strategy often used is random dialing,
random telephone dialing for example.

55
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.360
But, none the less, this is a good
strategy if you can do it, but

56
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.770
often you can't,
often it's not on the table.

57
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.360
What are some other strategies?

58
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.590
Well, waiting is another strategy when
again, random sampling is off the table.

59
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.920
The idea of waiting is
something like this,

60
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.170
imagine in your sample you have
twice as many men as you have women.

61
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.696
However, you know in the population
that you're interested in drawing

62
00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:42.714
inferences about,
there's equal numbers of men and women.

63
00:03:42.714 --> 00:03:45.461
In your sample then when you
were doing your analysis,

64
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.388
you would upweight the collection
of women that you had and

65
00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:50.930
you would down weight
the collection of men.

66
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.470
So that as far as the weighted
inferences were concerned,

67
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.600
the women and
men were contributing equally, okay?

68
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.760
So that's the process of weighting.

69
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.260
Again, this requires that you know the
population demographics through respect to

70
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.329
these important characteristics and that
you have them measured in your sample.

71
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.980
Finally, the last strategy that I think
of, one the important three strategies for

72
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.450
dealing with bias, is modeling.

73
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.170
In our modeling case, what we would
say is we would want to understand

74
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.770
why it is that on whatever we were
measuring, gender made a difference.

75
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.420
And we would try to model that and
account for it and

76
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.030
then use our statistical
model to adjust for it.

77
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.400
This has the problem of actually
having to build the model and

78
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.910
whether or not our conclusions
are robust to this model building.

79
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.730
Things like having a random sample
are quite robust to a lot of assumptions

80
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.870
whereas modeling can often be fraught
with errors associated with assumption.

81
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.950
So again, those are three strategies
that you can use to combat bias.

82
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.510
So let me summarize.

83
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.140
So bias comes in many forms and
can contaminate your analysis,

84
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.900
especially your statistical inferences.

85
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.830
Sampling in bias,
which we talked a lot about today,

86
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.740
is a particularly common one whereby
your sample isn't indicative

87
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.020
of the population you'd like
to make inferences is about.

88
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.210
We talked about three strategies for
combatting sampling bias.

89
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.730
One was random sampling,
that's at the design stage, and may or

90
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.720
may not be applicable in your case.

91
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.794
We talked about reweighting, okay?

92
00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:30.620
That's done in the analysis stage but

93
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.539
requires you to have specific
knowledge about the weights.

94
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.280
And then there's modeling, which, again,
is done at the analysis stage, however,

95
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.100
requires the model building exercise and
may or may not be

96
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.020
sensitive to some of those choices
that you make in building the model.

97
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.410
Well, I hope you found
this lecture useful, and

98
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.260
I look forward to seeing
you in the next class.
