00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.260
So in this lecture, we're going to
talk about ways to help us interpret

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.250
effects when we're studying something
that we don't know too well.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.220
And the idea is simply to compare
things with benchmark effects.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.440
So to summarize, here's the problem
that we're interested in.

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.830
Here's the real life
data analysis problem.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.420
It's hard to interpret an effect or its
magnitude because it's a newly, it's hard

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.230
to interpret an effect or its magnitude
because its a newly studied construct.

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.990
And the solution I'm going to propose is,
contrast the effect or the P value, or

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.740
the effect size, with the level of
significance, with a known construct.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.660
So let me give you an example,
just to kind of frame the discussion.

11
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.360
So a friend of mine named Brian Schwarz,

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.920
he's in environmental health here, wrote a
paper called, past adult lead exposure is

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.430
linked to neurodegeneration
as measured by brain MRI.

14
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.990
And what they found is, that unadjusted
effect estimate of -1.141 milliliters of

15
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.140
brain volume per 1 microgram of lead
per gram of bone mineral increase.

16
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.440
Which is a hard thing to interpret,
but it's basically saying you'll lose

17
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.200
about 1.14 milliliters of brain volume for
every 1 unit increase in lead exposure.

18
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.152
He was looking at people who worked
in lead manufacturing plants.

19
00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:28.360
They are worried that the chronic
exposure to lead was causing

20
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.500
accelerated brain volume decline beyond
that would occur in normal aging.

21
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.410
Okay, so
how do would interpret this -1.14?

22
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.740
We just gave the interpretation.

23
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.340
Right?
It had the units of the problem.

24
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.600
However, there is the problem that I
still kinda don't know what that means.

25
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.090
So here's the idea of putting it into
a context with a related phenomenon.

26
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.020
So just to remind us, and here I'm just
looking at one version of the effect.

27
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.540
The paper, of course,
really drilled down in this problem, so

28
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.800
that the one version of this effect,
the unadjusted effect was negative 1.41.

29
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.210
So, a decrease in brain volume
as lead exposure increases.

30
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.000
I don't understand that effect terribly
well because I'm not an expert on lead.

31
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.810
But I do know some things
about normal aging.

32
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.182
Normal aging, over the age of 40,

33
00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:26.270
results in about a half a percent of
decline in brain volume per year.

34
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.770
Okay.

35
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.310
So, I know it's roughly about that,
maybe that estimate's a little high,

36
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.970
but let's say it's roughly about that.

37
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.960
So, if I take that half a percent
decline in brain volume per year, and

38
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.290
I look at the average brain volume from
Brian's study, then I can figure out

39
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.890
that 1.41 decrease is roughly equivalent
to about about 20% of a year.

40
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.180
So basically, we're saying this effect,
that a one unit increase in lead,

41
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.510
in lead exposure results
in brain volume loss.

42
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.810
That's about the same amount of
volume loss that people experience

43
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.670
in about 20% of the year
over the age of 40.

44
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.365
So to me, that's more interpretable,
because I understand, in this case,

45
00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:18.185
because I understand about healthy brain
aging, because I work in the area.

46
00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:22.555
And so, what I'm trying to convince you
to do, is when you're looking at this

47
00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:27.270
complicated effect measure,
put it in to compare it,

48
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.540
put it into a contrast with something
that you're very familiar with.

49
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.850
In this case, I'm very familiar
with normal, healthy aging.

50
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.340
I'm not too familiar with lead exposure
and its effects on the brain, so

51
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.050
I'm going to perform this comparison.

52
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.450
And this is a highly powerful technique
for bringing and explaining concepts,

53
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.190
and its especially useful when
you put these new constructs

54
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.660
into the frame of something that
everyone in the room is familiar with.

55
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.320
So again, this is a technique that is
used all the time in epidemiology and

56
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.990
public health and biostatistics, and
I suggest you try it out in your studies.
