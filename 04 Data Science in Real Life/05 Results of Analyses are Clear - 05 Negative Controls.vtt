Hi.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.530
This is the lecture on negative controls.

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.948
So this is part of our discussion of
looking at statistically significant or

4
00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:15.760
non-significant results and
adding meat to our hypothesis testing.

5
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.450
And in this case, what we're
concerned with is the problem of,

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.210
did the process that we
executed the hypothesis in,

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.740
was that what created the significance, or
was it a real intrinsically true effect?

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.600
Okay.

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.180
So let's restate the problem.

10
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.330
You're worried that your results are more
due to process than a real effect.

11
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.660
Well how do you check?

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.310
Well there's a lot of ways and a lot of
the mechanisms of statistical significance

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.970
are trying to check against that.

14
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.110
They're evaluating your results relative
to the uncertainty in your data and so on.

15
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.820
But this, what I'm about to present
is a very practical solution to that.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.180
Just a real sort of more data
science-y way to think about it.

17
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.230
And the idea is to perform
a negative control.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.620
And you're basically going
to repeat the study for

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.410
a variable that is known
to have no association.

20
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.230
So, let me give you a very famous
example in the area that I work in.

21
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.050
What everyone is talking about in

22
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.230
brain activation studies now,
is in this idea of connectivity.

23
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.905
That two different areas of the brain,

24
00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:27.820
their brain activity tends
to track with one another.

25
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.790
And that's the idea of
so-called connectivity.

26
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.330
It's interesting to note that
what someone did at one point

27
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.010
is they used all these tools
that people like me and

28
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.200
other people that work in the area have
developed, and they looked at them

29
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.740
in an area of the brain where there
is no brain, the ventricles, okay?

30
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.100
So the in the ventricles there's
nothing but cerebral spinal fluid, so

31
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.315
there's nothing there.

32
00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:57.640
And for two locations in the ventricles,

33
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.280
they used the same techniques that we
use for two locations in the brain

34
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.100
to study correlations or
connectivity as we like to call it.

35
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.570
And what they found is
significant results.

36
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.780
And that's an interesting finding
cuz there's no brain there, so

37
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.860
it's not brain conductivity they're
finding, it purely has to do with process.

38
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.560
And what they found out is that this
was due to a couple of interesting

39
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.870
artifactual components of the data.

40
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.290
One, it was due to sort of head motion.

41
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.160
As people move their head, it created
similar patterns in the two locations in

42
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.290
this area of the ventricles and
that caused correlations.

43
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.700
Those effects permeated the rest
of the image, so a lot of

44
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.660
what people were reporting as connectivity
was really due to head motion.

45
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.140
It's also true that as we breathe,
and as our heart beats,

46
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.370
that changes the character of
the signal dynamically and

47
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.710
those were also related to
creating spurious correlations.

48
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.415
The broader point, though,
is that what these investigators did

49
00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:09.430
is they repeated an analysis
that everyone was excited about.

50
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.490
Everyone was excited about
finding remote correlations in

51
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.220
the brain that were
putatively brain networks and

52
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.600
understanding how they were related
to disease and stuff like that.

53
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.180
However, what these researchers did is,

54
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.180
they said okay let's just study
the process by looking at an instance

55
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.940
where we know that there can't be
an effect, but in every other sense,

56
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.230
we've replicated the analysis in exactly
the same way and they found an effect.

57
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.153
So these kinds of negative controls offer
a very simple way to investigate spurious

58
00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:44.610
effects due to things like confounding or
multiplicity.

59
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.270
In this case, it was confounding.

60
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.989
The correlation between this two voxels is
actually confounded by head motion, for

61
00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:51.590
example.

62
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.560
So what are the characteristics
of a good negative control?

63
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.076
Well, they're variables that are realistic
but known to have no association.

64
00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.073
So in this case, they had a perfect one.

65
00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:09.221
They had something that was in the image
already, that they could look at,

66
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:13.879
it was subject to all the same
processing experience that the rest of

67
00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.390
the brain got and so this was a good
version of a negative control.

68
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.730
If there's one criticism of negative
control, it's often very hard to

69
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.460
find something where you know for
sure there can't possibly be an effect.

70
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.850
So another strategy that
people employ rather than

71
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.520
executing things like negative controls,
is they do things like permutation tests.

72
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.370
They actually formally break
the association by permuting one of

73
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.790
the variables so that there can't be
an association, they've broken it.

74
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.960
So that's a little bit more of an advance
of a topic, but the idea is quite similar.

75
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.030
So this is a simple technique.

76
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.420
And if you're feeling queasy about

77
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.590
a process that one of the people you're
managing went through, a very long,

78
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.140
complicated set of data munging and
analysis and several models being built,

79
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.320
ask them to just repeat the whole
process for something that is,

80
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.950
on face value, can't possibly exhibit
an association, and see what comes out.

81
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.610
And it's a great way to
offer a sanity check,

82
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.150
and to check influences due to process.
