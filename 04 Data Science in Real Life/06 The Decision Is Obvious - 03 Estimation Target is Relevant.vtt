00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.071
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo and

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.000
this is the lecture on
Estimation Target being Relevant.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.450
And so I'm gonna start with this quote
from, it's attributed to lots of people,

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.300
I give some example up there
which you can find on Wikipedia.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.820
But of course many of
you have heard the song.

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.060
But if you can't be with the one you love,
love the one you're with.

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.040
And that's the idea behind some of these

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.710
surrogate variables we're
gonna talk about today.

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.700
If you can't measure the variable you
want, measure the variable you got.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.920
Okay, so what we're basically
talking about in this lecture,

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.420
is when you have an outcome you
are interested in studying, but

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.230
you can't actually measure it.

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.530
You can only measure some surrogate for
it.

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.870
And we are gonna talk about
the benefits and pitfalls and

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.900
some strategies that you can do
this very common circumstance.

16
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.900
But, even if you don't find
that prior quote less inspire.

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.560
Even if you don't find that
prior quote inspiring,

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.910
even less inspiring is the classic joke
that talks about the drunk looking for

19
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.090
his keys under the lamp post.

20
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.880
And the police comes up to him and
asks, what are you doing?

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.560
And the drunk says, looking for my keys.

22
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.390
And the policeman says, well,
did you drop them near here?

23
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.380
And the drunk says,
no I dropped them over there.

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.331
And he's, well, why are you looking here?

25
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.840
And the drunk says,
cuz this is where the light is.

26
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.948
Okay, so let's talk about surrogate
variables and hopefully we won't be

27
00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:41.231
like drunks looking under the lamppost,
hopefully our keys'll be nearby.

28
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.535
So, the idea behind what we're talking
about today, is it's very common

29
00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:52.338
to not be able to directly measure what
is most germane to your investigation,

30
00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:54.930
what you really want to measure.

31
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.670
So, some classic examples.

32
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.040
Body mass index as a measure
of body fat percentage.

33
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.200
So, Bbdy mass index is really
just only take two measurements.

34
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.431
Your weight and your height.

35
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:09.980
But a real measure of body fat
percentage is much harder.

36
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.390
It takes much more careful measurement,
so BMI is a surrogate variable for

37
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.119
what people really want,
which is body fat percentage.

38
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.070
It's very common for economists to use
GDP as a measure of economic well-being,

39
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.430
even though they fully acknowledge
that it's a crude summary of that.

40
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.560
Probably one of the worst, not worst,
probably one of the hardest examples

41
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.940
are food frequency questionnaires for
calorie consumptions.

42
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.240
So, if you just ask people what
they ate last week to try to and

43
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.840
ascertain their calorie consumption,
that's a very noisy measure,

44
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.040
but it's very hard to get good data
on what people eat either way.

45
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.270
Of course, if you ask people
whether they're going to vote,

46
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.099
you get likely voters, but that doesn't
mean you're gonna get actual voters.

47
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.620
If you measure web traffic that doesn't
mean it's sort of actual web traffic.

48
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.741
You might be getting lots of hits from
web crawlers and things like that.

49
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.660
Search engine crawlers and
that sort of thing.

50
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.481
So in my area, the area that I work in,

51
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:23.611
we study something called
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

52
00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:28.561
We would really like to measure people's
brain activation, we really wanna get at

53
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:33.509
let's say neuronal signaling, but we don't
get that, we get instead a very crude

54
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.771
proxy for this called the blood oxygen
level dependent or BOLD signal.

55
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:42.288
So, this phenomenon of not getting
to measure what you want, but

56
00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:46.067
getting the measure of some
surrogate that's close or

57
00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:49.040
hopefully close is a very common problem.

58
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.401
So what are some hallmarks
of good surrogates?

59
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:55.620
Well, the best surrogates
are gonna be unbiased.

60
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.740
Even if they're noisy and they're not
completely like the variable that they're

61
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.200
measuring, they're not systematically
larger or systematically smaller.

62
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.740
And ideally they have a known
variance around the desired outcome.

63
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.808
So in that case,
if you have a good surrogate variable.

64
00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:19.210
A very good surrogate is for

65
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.920
example, weight,
with a nice unbiased scale.

66
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.047
If you don't know the person's
actual weight but

67
00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:31.513
you have a scale that's kind of noisy but
on average across all people,

68
00:04:31.513 --> 00:04:36.661
it's as high as it is low and you actually
know how variable it is around the truth.

69
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:39.381
Then you can use that
information in your analysis and

70
00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:41.510
probably everything will be fine.

71
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.750
That's a very unusual circumstance.

72
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.740
Maybe the second best setting,
which at some level attainable.

73
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.520
Is where you have the truth measured
on some subset of the people and

74
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.768
you can study and
understand some amount of calibration.

75
00:04:58.768 --> 00:05:03.151
And I'm gonna give an example,
so a very common thing that

76
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:07.631
people do now is they wear,
I have a picture here of fitbit.

77
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:11.701
And this is a little accelerometer
that you wear around your wrist and

78
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:15.361
it counts things like steps,
but it's not measuring steps.

79
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:16.410
It's on your wrist.

80
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.841
It's measuring acceleration.

81
00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:22.450
So they have to use an algorithm to
predict how many steps you're making.

82
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.630
So and sometimes it's accurate and
sometimes it's not.

83
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.990
And maybe even further, your software,
your fitbit software or

84
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.770
your calorie count, your accelerometer
on your watch or your cell phone, will

85
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.230
also not only give you steps but it'll
actually give you calorie consumption.

86
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.461
So what could you do?

87
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:45.243
Well, if you were very serious
about studying accelerometry,

88
00:05:45.243 --> 00:05:50.300
what you could do is really get people
in the lab, put a mask on them.

89
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.090
Really get very careful measurements
of steps and calorie consumption

90
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.080
while they are wearing a fitbit,
they are wearing these other devices.

91
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.560
And use that to understand
its degree of accuracy.

92
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.580
You could maybe build up models because
you know the truth on that subset

93
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.110
of people, and
using those models employ the strategies

94
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.080
from those models in the instances
where you only have the fitbit data and

95
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.290
you don't have the gold standard data.

96
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.140
So doing a gold standard study,

97
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.740
is probably one of the better
things that you can do.

98
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.080
And if you have that option,

99
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.950
I would highly recommend taking the time
to actually study the variables,

100
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.000
these surrogate variables
that you are looking at.

101
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.230
And I think what often happens at least
In my experience in the scientific world,

102
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.620
whenever we go after these surrogate
variables, and try and figure out how

103
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.490
accurate they are, we always seem to come
away surprised at how inaccurate they are.

104
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.961
How much less accurate they
were then we thought they were.

105
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:59.938
So at any rate, that is the strategy,
that is very helpful but

106
00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:04.344
if you don't have those
strategies available to you,

107
00:07:04.344 --> 00:07:10.030
well the worst case scenario is you
have to acknowledge limitations.

108
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.981
You don't have a real way
to validate your surrogate.

109
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:17.596
Maybe using some external data that you
didn't collect, maybe that's an option,

110
00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:21.431
but let's suppose none of these
circumstances are available to you.

111
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:25.680
Then you wanna make sure you
use skepticism of your results.

112
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.771
For example if you're analyzing BMI and
treating it as if it's body

113
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:34.219
fat percentage, then you want to think
about your sample and say, well,

114
00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:37.159
do I have a lot of body builders and
midgets and and

115
00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:41.301
extremely tall people in my sample
where BMI may not be as accurate?

116
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:44.034
Or is my sample kind of in
this range where we know,

117
00:07:44.034 --> 00:07:48.430
it's probably kind of okay and
tends to sort of be and unbiased measure.

118
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.018
You wanna use skepticism in
studying your results and

119
00:07:52.018 --> 00:07:56.411
thing about the noise associate
with your surrogate variables.

120
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:03.022
And another reasonable strategy is
to use sensitivity analysis for

121
00:08:03.022 --> 00:08:06.680
bias and
variability of your surrogate variable.

122
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.608
So what I mean by sensitivity analysis is,
come up with some idea of how off it's

123
00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:14.491
going to be for
the individual measurements.

124
00:08:14.491 --> 00:08:17.767
And come up with an idea of how
biased it could possibly be, so

125
00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:22.076
if you're studying a food frequency
questionnaire, you might think, okay,

126
00:08:22.076 --> 00:08:26.451
well, what if these food frequency
questionnaires are really underestimating

127
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:30.160
calorie consumptions by
a thousand calories per day?

128
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.140
Think about that, and
then factor that into the analysis and

129
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.018
see what would happen.

130
00:08:34.018 --> 00:08:37.975
So sensitivity analysis
are always at your disposal and

131
00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:40.584
they're a good way to sort of poke and

132
00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:46.491
prod at what are the consequences of not
measuring what you really want to measure.

133
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:50.517
And I have this funny thing that says
limitations, until you spread your wings

134
00:08:50.517 --> 00:08:54.188
you have no idea how far you can walk and
there's a picture of a penquin.

135
00:08:54.188 --> 00:08:57.760
I thought that was terrible,
put it up anyway.

136
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.480
And then when to throw in the towel.

137
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:07.840
So, I thought a lot about recommending
when you throw in the towel,

138
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.940
and so this is the resolution that
I came up with, is prior to running

139
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:18.250
your analysis, think about how you're
going to interpret your results.

140
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.550
And if the variable that
you're going to use in lieu

141
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:25.830
of the one that you really want is so
unknown and so

142
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.880
unreliable in estimate
of the desired outcome.

143
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.190
That no results would
change your decision or

144
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.410
state of knowledge, then why bother
running the analysis at all?

145
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.790
So, what I would do is go through the
exercise before you perform the analysis,

146
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.810
before you collect the data.

147
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.750
And then kinda think about your
decision space in the event that

148
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.869
the results come out exactly
as you would hope, or

149
00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:57.300
in the event that the results come up
the exact opposite of what you would hope.

150
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.210
Is the fact that
the surrogate variable is so

151
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.030
inaccurate relative to what
you're trying to measure.

152
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:11.297
If that's true in neither of those
extremes would it really change your

153
00:10:11.297 --> 00:10:16.916
decision space, then you either need
to improve your surrogate variable,

154
00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.311
do some gold standard studies.

155
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:21.313
Or get a new variable or
something like that,

156
00:10:21.313 --> 00:10:23.980
cuz it's probably not
worth doing at that point.

157
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.280
But I do think if you have
a really noisy surrogate variable,

158
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.070
it is at least worthwhile
to think about whether or

159
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.990
not you're actually gonna
get anything valuable at all

160
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.939
out of your analyses before you undertake
the costly exercise of actually doing it.

161
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.370
