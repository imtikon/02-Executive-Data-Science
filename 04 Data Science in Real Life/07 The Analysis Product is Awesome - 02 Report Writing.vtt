00:00:02.031 --> 00:00:03.683
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo and

2
00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:08.320
this is the lecture on report writing as
part of the Executive Data Science series.

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.840
So report writing is, often

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.720
the case you get reports that
are just really problematic.

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.890
And I think that's more of
the norm than getting clear,

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.610
concise, reproducible reports
that have a obvious and

7
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.330
clear narrative and tell a clear story.

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.640
More often, your reports are a little
bit of a mis-mash of thoughts.

9
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.990
And so in this lecture, what we're
going to talk about are some tools

10
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.260
that will help at least certain
aspects of the report writing.

11
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.270
Of course, there's a lot to
whatever specific area you're in

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.730
to the art in that area of how your
reports are gonna get generated.

13
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.640
But some of these tools
are ubiquitous enough across

14
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.309
scenarios that we can give
some general recommendations.

15
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.600
So, in a perfect world,
reports would be clear and

16
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.060
reproducible, kind of the two
most important characteristics.

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300
And so
we're just gonna give three strategies for

18
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.620
helping manage report writing.

19
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.760
The first one I can say, which seems
ridiculous, but it seems to help a lot and

20
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.040
it's encouraged checking the signs,
the magnitudes and

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.790
the units of effects that are reported.

22
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.560
The second one is to focus
on interpretation and

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.090
interpretability of the report.

24
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.530
And the third is to use
reproducible research tools.

25
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.670
So let me just briefly elaborate on
this point on checking the signs,

26
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.079
the magnitudes, and the units.

27
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.530
So the signs, for example,
what do I mean by that?

28
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.220
I basically mean to check to make
sure the directions of the effects

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.560
are as anticipated.

30
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.640
And this can often happen in a case.

31
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.160
The worst example of this is when
the report only gives the output of

32
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.220
a regression analysis without actually
interpreting the coefficients.

33
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.320
Well the most basic form of interpretation
of the coefficient is just checking

34
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.160
that it's in the direction that
everyone would anticipate that it's in.

35
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.331
So in this case I said,

36
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:21.543
are brain volumes decreasing with
increasing Alzheimer's disease symptoms?

37
00:02:21.543 --> 00:02:27.096
If you saw the opposite effect if
you saw a brain volumes increasing,

38
00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.310
then you would be worried.

39
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.250
Or at least that would
merit some explanation.

40
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.660
The second idea was magnitudes.

41
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.890
We wanna compare the magnitudes
effects with other known effects.

42
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.340
So volume loss is similar to
a decade of normal aging,

43
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.480
is akin to the example
we gave from before.

44
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.210
So we've talked about this idea
before of taking effects for

45
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.220
things that you're studying that you don't
know a lot about, and contrasting them

46
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.470
with the effects of things that you know a
lot about, like normal aging in this case.

47
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.330
The third thing is the units.

48
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.780
And I can't stress this enough,
make sure that the units are known,

49
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.340
they're written out explicitly and
they're included on all graph axes.

50
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.320
So just to give you an anecdote,
at one point we were all sitting

51
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.340
around discussing an effect that
we saw for brain volume and

52
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.150
we realized that we had messed up the
units at some point and people's brains

53
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.450
were supposedly growing at the size of a
house every year, or something like that.

54
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.790
And it was only through the exercise
of checking the units and

55
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.030
making sure that the units of our
coefficient really made sense relative

56
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.510
to the context of the problem that
we kind of caught that error and

57
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.280
found that one of our variables had
been multiplied by a strange constant.

58
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.821
And so at any rate, the units, and
again it's a simple thing, but

59
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:56.330
just drill down on the units
on any given problem.

60
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.410
Understanding the units really
helps you understand the problem.

61
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.830
So the second point I made was to focus
on interpretation and interpretability.

62
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.820
So again, I'm gonna reiterate that
comparing effects to other known effects

63
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.290
is a great way to focus on
interpretation and interpretability.

64
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.450
The second way to focus
on interpretation and

65
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.000
interpretability is to
encourage so-called parsimony.

66
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.320
Parsimony, to me, is a key ingredient
to having interpretable models.

67
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.540
And what I mean by parsimony is using the
simplest possible model and no simpler.

68
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.590
In other words, I'm encouraging you
to place a premium on simplicity.

69
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.050
So if you have a regression model,

70
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.820
regression models tend to be pretty
simple models, that achieve 95% of

71
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.380
the prediction performance of some
complicated machine learning algorithm.

72
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.920
You might wanna just stick with the
regression model because that 5% penalty

73
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.910
of complexity is really a very high price.

74
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.920
You're losing a lot of interpretability
for that extra 5% prediction.

75
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.250
So in this case I would suggest
encouraging in the report writing

76
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.810
focusing on the regression results.

77
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.240
Or maybe doing both, but
especially reporting and

78
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.750
giving good interpretations of
the regression coefficient,

79
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.150
which are much more interpretable than
the output of a complex algorithm.

80
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.646
The third idea that I find very useful,

81
00:05:21.646 --> 00:05:25.200
is the idea of what I like
to call effect critiquing.

82
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.512
And if you see a significant effect,
or something that's very exciting,

83
00:05:30.512 --> 00:05:36.260
then what you want to do is

84
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.860
try to put yourself in the mind of someone
who would be a skeptic of that effect.

85
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.870
Try to be as skeptical and
critical as possible.

86
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.880
And once you're in that mindset,

87
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.110
then try to come up with
the counter-arguments for that effect.

88
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.450
Okay, so we saw this effect on lead
exposure and brain volume loss.

89
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.260
But was it really due to something else,
like the different

90
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.250
body mass indexes of the people who were
exposed to lead to the people who weren't?

91
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.380
So it's really not due to lead exposure,
it's really due to body mass.

92
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.700
Okay that would be
an example of a critique.

93
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.490
So what will we do?

94
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.640
We might consider a model that
then had lead exposure and

95
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.770
body mass in the model, just to see what
impact looking at both simultaneously did

96
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.480
on the effect that we're interested in,
the lead exposure.

97
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.010
Okay?

98
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.830
So the broader point in this case is to
think like a critic of your effect, and

99
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.390
that will inform additional analyses you
want to do to counter those arguments.

100
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.890
And I think, if possible,
you could get other groups of people to

101
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.490
serve in the role as an internal
critic in order to try to help you

102
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.000
generate new ways to poke and
prod at an exciting or

103
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.780
apparently significant effect, to poke and
prod at it and see if it really is real.

104
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.830
Now reproducability is a big
topic around here, Roger Peng,

105
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.710
one of the co instructors in the series
is one of the leading researchers and

106
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.130
thinkers on the idea of reproducibility.

107
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.590
But I love this Tweet by this person, Ben
Hamner, who I don't know, who said, When

108
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.010
you write code, keep in mind that you're
collaborating with your future self.

109
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.460
So, for reproducibility in a report,

110
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.430
you wanna make sure that these
reports can get regenerated.

111
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.160
You'll get the exact same numbers.

112
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.720
The report contains
the information available

113
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.370
to reproduce all of the numbers and
analyses in it.

114
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.680
Fortunately for
the people that you're managing,

115
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.350
there are a lot of tools
available now that merge

116
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.530
the data analysis and
the report writing into a single document.

117
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.880
And the two most popular in my mind are
knitr, which is a tool for R specifically,

118
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.920
and the idea is knitting the analysis and
the report writing together.

119
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.050
And then IPython Notebooks
are another one.

120
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.340
And you should highly encourage the people
you're managing to use tools like these.

121
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.900
Maybe not these specific tools, but
I would recommend these specific tools.

122
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.990
But tools like these, in order to make
sure that your reports are reproducible

123
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:16.270
and they leave a documented trail

124
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:21.780
of exactly how to go from
the data to the final analyses.

125
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.054
So these are three simple rules,
or three broad categories I think

126
00:08:27.054 --> 00:08:32.721
that can help improve report writing
across a broad spectrum of areas.
